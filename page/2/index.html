            <p class="note title">Great Britain Trip</p><p class="note date">2014-08-24</p><p class="note content">The last 2 weeks the wife and I were touring about Great Britain. We had busy days for sure with some tours and bus-rides scheduled in advance, and a couple days left unscheduled until the night before in the various cities we stayed in. I&rsquo;ve been calling this trip our 2nd Honeymoon, the first one we had was Costa Rica and was more of a Eco-Tour sort of thing while we wandered around trails and peaks within rainforests.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/dd_next/">
            <p class="note title">D&D Next</p><p class="note date">2014-08-23</p><p class="note content">Wizards of the Coast posted early drafts of the Core Rules of D&amp;D Next, also known as 5th edition. Whether this will remain in place when it actually releases with hard cover books or not I do not know. They&rsquo;re very slim with only a few classes, races, and spells.
I looked over the PHB for an hour and I was surprised by the return of a lot of earlier mechanics such as spell slot progressions, and all 9 alignments.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/hope_2014/">
            <p class="note title">HOPE 2014</p><p class="note date">2014-08-03</p><p class="note content">A few weekends ago I was in New Your City attending the 10th HOPE conference, which is short for Hackers on Planet Earth. I enjoyed this one more than the last DefCons I&rsquo;ve been to (17 and 20), and I want to share why.
DefCon is very much about the technology, and the scene. Presenters are comfortable being informal and provocative with their content. It&rsquo;s cool to be a hacker, and fuck anyone that says otherwise!<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/vg_soundtracks/">
            <p class="note title">VG Soundtracks</p><p class="note date">2014-06-08</p><p class="note content">A lengthy email thread about video game soundtracks manifested at work over the last week. The original question posed was, &ldquo;Does anyone else listen to game soundtracks as regular music?&rdquo; The content was too good too let die within the company, so here is a consolidated list of recommendations.
 Fallout 1 and 2 Remixes Dune Spice Operat, strongly recommended Ben Prunty for FTL Ben Crossbones Dimaension X, Doom 2 remixes Doom 1 remixes Roland SC-55 remixes for various games Disasterpeace, the FEZ composer Mass Effect remixes Songs to test By, Portal 2 music Gustavo Santaolalla Swordcraft to Spacecraft, a Pandora station curated by a coworker Where to find video game music DJ Cutman GameChops  Other recommendations that are not easily downloadable are: Final Fantasy music, PPPPPPP the VVVVVV soundtrack, The Real Texas, Hotline Miami, SimCity 3000, Bit.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/shadow_warrior/">
            <p class="note title">Shadow Warrior</p><p class="note date">2014-05-29</p><p class="note content">Remember this game where you played as Lo Wang? In 2013 a remake was released, and it is actually pretty good if you go in with the right expectations. It brings with it a passable story, pretty graphics, appropriate music, a solid (and simple) leveling system, and of course, his inappropriate swearing and leud jokes.
&ldquo;You mess with the bull, you get the Wang.&rdquo; You magnificent fuck.
About 15 hours of gameplay are available in this game, and all of it is entertaining.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/gin/">
            <p class="note title">Gin</p><p class="note date">2014-05-29</p><p class="note content">I like Gin, it&rsquo;s my spirit of choice. Currently there are 7 different varieties in my cabinet.
For mixers (a drink where you add a soda or juice) where I don&rsquo;t need a high quality Gin, I usually go with Bombay Sapphire. It is a good quality Gin for sure, and in restaurants with a modest bar that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll pick too.
For cocktails, it depends on the style I&rsquo;m going for; there are 2 categories of Gin to consider: American and London-dry.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/dark_souls_2/">
            <p class="note title">Dark Souls 2</p><p class="note date">2014-04-05</p><p class="note content">This morning I reached Earthen Peak.
I have been deliberately not reading major spoilers or walkthroughs for the game, so I have no idea how far along I am. I have 2 Big Souls (I forget what they&rsquo;re really called) so far, one from The Lost Sinner, and one from The Rotten. I&rsquo;m playing a lightly-equipped sword-and-shield character right now: no spells, heavy on the dexterity stat. I think I&rsquo;m about Soul Level 80.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/this_and_that/">

            <p class="note title">Big Space Port</p><p class="note date">2014-02-06</p><p class="note content">Remember those 4 doom levels I made years ago? Well, with Eureka, I touched those up and added 2 more. I renamed the collection Big Space Port, and it was successfully uploaded to the idgames archive.
Maybe in the future I&rsquo;ll continue the mapping, but for now, my bi-annual Doom phase is over. If you need an engine, I recommend Chocolate Doomfor that classic feel, or GZDoomfor a modern take with improved graphics and sound.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/hello_from_brno_cz/">
            <p class="note title">Hello From Brno, CZ</p><p class="note date">2014-02-04</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m writing this message from Brno, a city in the Czech Republic! It began by flying into Amsterdam, picking up a connecting flight to Vienna in Austria, and then taking the Student Agency bus to Brno. From there I have been taking trams around the city to get around. I created a map to track places I&rsquo;ve visited while I am out here. Last night I caught dinner with a local coworker (and another coworker from Chicago) at the Pegas Pub.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

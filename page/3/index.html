            <p class="note title">Rooted!</p><p class="note date">2014-01-21</p><p class="note content">Before Christmas Muffin and I gave each other Galaxy S4 mobile phones. It was time to upgrade. They were by Samsung, model SCH-I545, Android version 4.3 and a baseband version of VRUEMK2. Those bits of data are important for people who want to root the device using these instructions. The XDA forums are the place to go for this sort of information; they were shockingly easy this time around. Far easier than the Incredible.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/thedarkmod/">
            <p class="note title">TheDarkMod</p><p class="note date">2014-01-19</p><p class="note content">A new Thief comes out later in February, but there&rsquo;s been a few red flags that have me suspicious. I&rsquo;ll be watching it, but I&rsquo;m waiting for reviews now instead of pre-ordering or purchasing the day-of. Check out the site and see if you come to the same conclusions.
I&rsquo;ve been playing TheDarkMod, a fan-made stand-alone game that behaves a lot like the older Thief games. It was originally a mod for the Doom 3 engine, but back in October it was re-released as a standalone program.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/docker/">
            <p class="note title">Docker</p><p class="note date">2014-01-15</p><p class="note content">Permit me to talk shop for a while. Docker is a project that makes an interesting use of Linux containers to package up applications and services. Containers in Linuxare an artificial way to create a space in which a process can run with limited resources exposed. You can create a container that has network access but only limited bandwidth, or can only occupy one core of your CPU. It&rsquo;s a lightweight form of virtualization, but it&rsquo;s not exactly the same thing.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/gus_greguske_2007-2014/">
            <p class="note title">Gus Greguske (2007-2014)</p><p class="note date">2014-01-15</p><p class="note content">Gus was our cat. Muffin made the difficult decision to have him put down a couple days ago after being diagnosed with diabetes a couple months ago. She picked him up from a shelter in Pennsylvania while in grad school, and his company helped keep her focused enough to obtain her PhD. His playful nature responded well to her bright and happy personality. I won&rsquo;t forget the times when she would descend the stairs to the basement while with a book in one hand and Gus in the other, ready to park on the couch while I ganked and swore at people in Dark Souls.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/games_in_2014/">
            <p class="note title">Games in 2014</p><p class="note date">2014-01-02</p><p class="note content">Happy New Year everyone, the Year of Predictions is finally here. I made that title up.
Have you been following video game releases for this year? I had not, until Rock, Paper, Shotgun posed a question to their community: what are you looking forward to this year? I cruised the comments and found a wealth of recommendations that were interesting at least. There were others that were either not the kind of thing I&rsquo;m interested in, or the development progress was so vague I doubted it would see a 2014 release.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/eureka/">
            <p class="note title">Eureka</p><p class="note date">2013-12-30</p><p class="note content">A few months ago a friend and I started talking about Doom, the classic game from the early 90s. Later that week I was over his house, where he was playing the game on his laptop. I go through this phase as well, every 2 years or so revisiting the game and playing a bunch of patch wads (custom maps) from the idgames archives.
In the later stages of the phase I grab a doom map editor and work on one.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/basement/">
            <p class="note title">Basement</p><p class="note date">2013-09-29</p><p class="note content">My basement is almost finished, and if you&rsquo;re cool enough to be on G+ you can see the pictures with the link.
The project started in late April, and will be finished this week. It cost about $9,000 from start to finish. I hired contractors twice: once for mudding, and again for finishing the stairs. For muddling I just didn&rsquo;t want to spend the time on it, and the carpentry work for the stairs (including the banister and laying the carpet down) was beyond my ability learn on the fly.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fedora_badges/">
            <p class="note title">Fedora Badges</p><p class="note date">2013-08-21</p><p class="note content">Fedora contributors can now get badges (read: achievements) for doing things like submitting builds, code commits, wiki edits and a bunch of other things. My badge collection is pathetic.It turns out this has been effective in getting contributors to contribute harder. I cannot say for certain whether it entices new contributors.
I can&rsquo;t say I expected an achievement system for my professional life, but there it is. While I am a package maintainer, I only have 1, it rarely changes, and the user base is tiny; it is probably just me.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/compy_loyalty/">
            <p class="note title">Compy Loyalty</p><p class="note date">2013-07-22</p><p class="note content">A podcast from a couple years ago prompted this question in my mind: Can you name 10 companies you would identify yourself as loyal to? Would you stick with them through the good times and the bad? Please omit the ones you work for since loyalty is implied there.
I can easily come up with a list of companies I despise. Here&rsquo;s those I like though, for now at least:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/anime_apnea/">
            <p class="note title">Anime Apnea</p><p class="note date">2013-07-22</p><p class="note content">The wife has the Netflix account and does way more viewing than I do. Recently a few anime series were recommended that we watched together. The first was Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit, and then came Black Butler. I won&rsquo;t got into summaries here, you can use the links for that. Instead I&rsquo;ll briefly explain what I liked and disliked.
Moribito is the type of anime I like, the target audience is meant to be mature and it spends a fair amount of time exploring the world they created.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

            <p class="note title">Honeymoon: San Jose</p><p class="note date">2010-08-17</p><p class="note content">Yesterday Muffin and I returned from our Costa Rican Honeymoon, a two week long eco-tour trip. Overall the trip was a success: we didn&rsquo;t think about work or any stress-inducing issues at home at all. Nobody could contact us in any form since cell phones were unusable (I didn&rsquo;t even bring mine or the laptop).
We traveled to 4 locations: San Jose, Tortuguero, Arenal, and Monteverde. The break down of time is as follows: 1 night in San Jose, 3 in Tortuguero, 5 in Arenal, 3 in Monteverde, and 1 more in San Jose.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/music_library_tools_m4a_to_mp3/">
            <p class="note title">Music Library Tools: m4a to mp3</p><p class="note date">2010-07-22</p><p class="note content">Many songs I have from iTunes are in the m4a format, but since iTunes doesn&rsquo;t exist on Fedora, I have to convert them if I want to listen to them there. I chose mp3 since that is the most interoperable even though it isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;free&rdquo; codec. We start with a simple shell script:
if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] ; then echo 'You must specify a path to an m4a file' exit 1 fi faad -o - &quot;$1&quot; | lame -V 0 - &quot;${1%.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/ion_2010/">
            <p class="note title">ION 2010</p><p class="note date">2010-07-07</p><p class="note content">This past weekend we attended Invasion of Normandy 2010, a paintball scenario game that involves over 3,200 players. We attended last year as well.
Our group was 7 strong this time, up from 3 last year. We had tons of fun. We saw less combat overall this year I think, we spent quite a bit of time hiking in the woods escorting an objective or defending territory. We spent less time on the front lines as well.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/vimrc/">
            <p class="note title">vimrc</p><p class="note date">2010-06-10</p><p class="note content">I recently read Hacking Vim in a fit of nerdiness. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t recommend the book: too much of it involved tricks for gvim, which I don&rsquo;t use and is not practical for use in my work environment. Still, I did glean several useful tricks and configuration tips that will be useful. I shall include my new and improved vimrc file here for others to peruse.
&quot; format the status bar :set laststatus=2 :set statusline=[%F%m%r] [%{&amp;ff}] [%lx%c] [%L] &quot; always show the tab bar :set showtabline=2 &quot; key mappings for adding/moving between tabs :map &lt;C-t&gt; :tabnew&lt;CR&gt; :map &lt;C-left&gt; :tabp&lt;CR&gt; :map &lt;C-right&gt; :tabn&lt;CR&gt; &quot; key mappings for moving by visual lines :nmap &lt;A-UP&gt; gk :nmap &lt;A-DOWN&gt; gj :imap &lt;A-UP&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;gki :imap &lt;A-DOWN&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;gji &quot; open a file named the same as a word the cursor is on :nmap gf :tabf &lt;cfile&gt;&lt;CR&gt; &quot; fill buffers with templates based on file extension :autocmd BufNewFile * silent!<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/metarpg_news/">
            <p class="note title">MetaRPG News</p><p class="note date">2010-04-30</p><p class="note content">MetaRPG is coming along well. In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve spent weekends working on the server code, and I&rsquo;ve taken an approach that so far, is functioning. There is still a lot to do, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that the client side is feature complete for the first release. This means I don&rsquo;t intend to add any new functionality to it, only supporting code to work with the server and bugfixes.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/stream_ripping/">
            <p class="note title">Stream Ripping</p><p class="note date">2010-04-02</p><p class="note content">Wednesday Illinoise implicitly told me he installed Fedora on his new system, so this post is a tribute to him as a reminder why Linux is more fun to work with for the hobby programmer. I tried to be pedantic and thorough so everyone can follow along. Consider this command:
ffmpeg -i $(find ~/.mozilla -regex &lsquo;.Cache.&rsquo; -a -not -regex &lsquo;.CACHE.&rsquo; -printf &lsquo;%T+ %p\n&rsquo; | sort -n | cut -f2 -d&rsquo; ' | xargs file | grep -i Video | awk -F : &lsquo;{ print $1 }&rsquo; | tail -1) -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -b 1024000 -ab 128 -s 640x480 video.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/killington_weekend/">
            <p class="note title">Killington Weekend</p><p class="note date">2010-04-02</p><p class="note content">Muffin and I learned to ski last weekend up at Killington, VT. We had 2 days of it with great weather and the instructors were very good at what they do. By the end of it we were exploring green trails on our own and risked a blue one where we each fell once or twice.
Even at the end of March the (manufactured) snow was in good shape and there was plenty to check out.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/pyrocket/">
            <p class="note title">pyrocket!</p><p class="note date">2010-03-14</p><p class="note content">I felt like tackling a short-term programming project. I own a USB Missile Launcher but unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to use it at work because the drivers &amp; application it comes with are Windows only.
So I hunted around for a linux solution, and came across one in Ubuntu called pyrocket. Not long after that discovery did I port it to Fedora. I don&rsquo;t have much to test with though; the package works with web cams, other models of launchers, and joysticks.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/tour_of_jerusalem/">

Scrolls of Fire
A monument outside of Jerusalem chronicling the restoration of the Jewish state.
Tomb of Mary
A site outside of Jerusalem where Mary was buried.
Other Sites
Other locales in and other of the city.

All 5 days I was in Ra&rsquo;anana office were mostly spent in meetings with development team leads. At 10am each day we&rsquo;d spend two hours talking about what was resolved, and what needs to be, they were meetings to keep the group focused for the day. The next 6-8 hours were informal meetings between the 2 of us from Release Engineering, and whichever team leads felt like sticking around.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

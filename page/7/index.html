            <p class="note title">9 Things I Wish the Elder Scrolls Would Fix</p><p class="note date">2011-12-04</p><p class="note content">There are 5 Elder Scrolls games: Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and most recently, Skyrim. While all decent games, there are some behaviors that just never seem to get get fixed: they afflict at least 3 of the 5 games. Here they are in no particular order.
Waterfalls do not sound like garden hoses draining from your rooftop.It is painfully obvious sometimes that Bethesda&rsquo;s Audio guys have never been to a real waterfall.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/dark_souls/">
            <p class="note title">Dark Souls</p><p class="note date">2011-10-15</p><p class="note content">Dark Souls is the successor to Demons&rsquo; Souls, not in the sense of a sequel though, just heavily inspired. Both of these games were well-received for their depth and difficulty.
The difficulty is the most well known characteristic of the game though. You cannot button-mash this game; it will punish you severely for it. There is no compass, no map, and a very sparse explanation of how things work. Every enemy in this game, even the lowly ones you encounter at the beginning, can and will remove large amounts of your health if you&rsquo;re not careful.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/yum_repository/">
            <p class="note title">Yum Repository</p><p class="note date">2011-10-02</p><p class="note content">For my non-work side projects I find myself packaging software for Fedora from time to time. I created a yum repository for those packages over here. So far it doesn&rsquo;t contain anything I want to brag about, just dependencies for projects I&rsquo;m getting involved with. I&rsquo;ll post more about those when I reach some kind of appreciable goal. MetaRPG might end up in there some day too.
For the Fedora-novice, take that text file and save it in /etc/yum.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/inmotion_hacked/">
            <p class="note title">InMotion Hacked</p><p class="note date">2011-09-25</p><p class="note content">About half an hour ago, Sans sent me a text saying I should check my brolem site and that I made a friend. Indeed I did, what I saw is the pic on the right.
More details on the hack are here, which I found with a google search of Tiger-Mate. InMotion is the hosting provider for Brolem.net, and multiple accounts were defaced, not just ours. The &ldquo;payload&rdquo; of the attack, and I confirmed this with InMotion support, is to drop an index.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/hacking_articles_and_presentations/">
            <p class="note title">Hacking Articles and Presentations</p><p class="note date">2011-08-30</p><p class="note content">I scraped a complete set of issues from Phrack Magazine. You can always peruse them on their site too, but in case it ever goes down, we have our own copies. If you want to be a l337 hax0r from when the sc3n3 was hip, read a few articles.
For more modern and practical hacking, I grabbed all non-video presentations from Defcon 10-19. The conventions before that are mostly video recordings with poor sound.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/google_hacking/">
            <p class="note title">Google Hacking</p><p class="note date">2011-08-11</p><p class="note content">Weeks ago I downloaded a Google+ app for my phone. While it is a convenient means to stay abreast of what folks are posting in my circles, there is one glaring &ldquo;feature&rdquo; I detest: if you enable location services (GPS, and Google/Verizon), the app will show you people near your location that also have G+ profiles. You can add nearby folks to your circles using this information.
I keep location services off because, as an Android phone, I have about 14 seconds of battery life, and enabling the GPS exacerbates the problem.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/mini-vacation/">

            <p class="note title">Top 5 Beers</p><p class="note date">2011-07-21</p><p class="note content">Some of you may be familiar with this site already, but for those who are not, I&rsquo;d like to show you BeerAdvocate, a beer rating site. Their database is considerably large, so you can usually find what you&rsquo;re looking for. The Education section is particularly good to help people &ldquo;mature&rdquo; into craft beers when you&rsquo;ve had enough Miller Time.
That all said, here are my top 5 beers today. It depends on what I&rsquo;m eating it with to say which I&rsquo;ll pick; there is no order here.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/google&#43;/">
            <p class="note title">Google+</p><p class="note date">2011-07-13</p><p class="note content">I accepted an invite to G+ today. We&rsquo;ll see if I regret this later.
So far it seems like something I can get into casually. Sparks are not very useful yet though, they appear to be stylized google searches of stuff you like. If I could integrate RSS feeds or something into my &ldquo;stream&rdquo; that&rsquo;d be much more useful.
Let me know if any of you want an invite.</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/desktop_configuration/">
            <p class="note title">Desktop Configuration</p><p class="note date">2011-06-12</p><p class="note content">I just installed Fedora 15 with Gnome Shell. While it does function and I can do the basics of what I like, there is still quite a bit to go with respect to configuration, preferences, and optimization. This post is meant to be a reminder for me when I reinstall next year, and a reference for anyone else doing an installation themselves. Sound and video

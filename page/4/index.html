            <p class="note title">boot.fedoraproject.org</p><p class="note date">2013-06-06</p><p class="note content">A week ago I reinstalled my home desktop with Fedora 18, but this installation marks the first time I did without downloading any of the traditional installation media. No CD, DVD or ISO image. I started the process by downloading a 364k file.
boot.fedoraproject.org (BFO) is a site designed to be booted from using iPXE, based on the work at boot.kernel.org (or BKO). I don&rsquo;t really know what that means either but in short, the little file I downloaded contains just enough of an operating system to get you to a working network stack, which then is used to connect your system to BFO to download additional grub (which is a boot loader) information.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/acbf_2013/">
            <p class="note title">ACBF 2013</p><p class="note date">2013-06-02</p><p class="note content">Once again Muffin and I went to the American Craft Beer Festival in Boston. We went to it last year as well. For this post I&rsquo;m just going to indicate what we&rsquo;ve tasted so far, this includes both me and Muffin&rsquo;s observations, taking an average if we both tried one. Last year&rsquo;s post can be reviewed to understand what the event is like. Thankfully it was indoors, away from the 92 degree heat.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/bathtub_gin/">
            <p class="note title">Bathtub Gin</p><p class="note date">2013-06-02</p><p class="note content">A few weeks ago I was in Seattle for work and met up with a past coworker for dinner. After that came drinks at a place he recommended: the Bathtub Gin Company. Imagine an alleyway with two red brick buildings on either side, and one of them has a huge black iron fire-escape. Now put brick walls in the alley in two places to seal away the fire escape and a little room.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/amon_tobin/">
            <p class="note title">Amon Tobin</p><p class="note date">2013-06-02</p><p class="note content">Friday night I was at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston to see Amon Tobin.
The show was not at all what I expected, but I probably had the wrong expectation. We arrived when the doors opened to the venue at 8pm, but to our surprise, there was only about 20 people there. It definitely was the right time and place. The venue is small: barely more than a night club with a stage.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/where_to_have_development_conversations/">
            <p class="note title">Where to Have Development Conversations</p><p class="note date">2013-05-06</p><p class="note content">This post is mine with my opinions. They are not Red Hat&rsquo;s. It relates the decision by Anaconda to not hide the root password when you enter it with stars or &ldquo;bullets&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s not uncommon to disagree with how a developer decides to add features or changes to their project. When that happens, most people have the decency to engage the developer(s) in a forum they are actively monitoring. They make their case engaging each other like adults, and come to some kind of resolution.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/office_survival_tips/">
            <p class="note title">Office Survival Tips</p><p class="note date">2013-04-11</p><p class="note content">The last couple months I&rsquo;ve been making a habit of going to the mini-gym in the office for 45 minutes or so before starting the work day. This is part of a broader effort to not be a just another flabby white software engineer. As a courtesy to my co-workers, I shower afterward and bring a change of clothes. Recently however, my perfect man-plan had a disastrous oversight.
Working out went without a problem, the mirrors around the room stood and acknowledged my efforts and proclaimed the results to others.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/how_to_get_extreme/">
            <p class="note title">How to Get Extreme</p><p class="note date">2013-03-15</p><p class="note content">With the new Pope getting chosen religion has been a popular topic around the folks I hang out with. Surrounded by engineers and software types it goes without saying that the majority of them are self proclaimed atheists or agnostics. Not all, but most. A small percentage of them though, I&rsquo;d describe as hostile to religious types in general. Any mention of the term will bring up a diatribe about the crusades, genocides, and whatever else can be laid at the feet of those fighting for &hellip; well whatever they thought was worth killing for.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fudcon_2013/">
            <p class="note title">FUDCon 2013</p><p class="note date">2013-01-22</p><p class="note content">Last week I was in Lawrence, Kansas attending the Fedora Users and Developers Conference and not enjoying Kansas BBQ because it was too far away from the city. However, the event itself was productive.
Like all FUDCons, it was barcamp style talks. I&rsquo;ll recap the ones I attended first:
 Cloud Server Stacks for F19 Secure Boot Q and A Overhauling the Release Model Coprs Intro to the Installer  Secure Boot and the Installer did not reveal anything novel to me.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/steam_on_fedora/">
            <p class="note title">Steam on Fedora</p><p class="note date">2013-01-08</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m a little late to the party but I got the Steam beta working on Fedora 17 with about 10 minutes of effort. I followed this guide. Currently Frozen Synapse, Amnesia and TF2 are available to play; I have not tried any yet since they need to be re-downloaded.
Update: Amnesia seems to work fine!
Very promising!</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/guild_wars_2/">
            <p class="note title">Guild Wars 2</p><p class="note date">2012-12-16</p><p class="note content">Lately my free time has been dominated by Guild Wars 2. It&rsquo;s usually dominated by a video game of one form or another, but now it is an MMO, one I&rsquo;ve been impressed with and would like to share.
GW2 does a much better job keeping things casual and making it easy to continue playing with your friends. The auto-leveling mechanic in particular surprised me: if you are too high level for an area, your effective level (and gear) will be reduced so that the area is still a challenge.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

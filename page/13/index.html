            <p class="note title">Dubious Intentions</p><p class="note date">2009-12-06</p><p class="note content">Been playing Dragon Age a lot lately with a 2nd character: a dwarf rogue commoner. I&rsquo;m also exploring the shadier quests and dialogue options, and sometimes the game lets me take certain &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; that probably wouldn&rsquo;t fly in real life. Here begins a catalogue of such actions.
 The guardsmen of a the local garrison need a morale boost before a fight with the undead. I suggested handing out a bunch of silver holy symbols with no magical power at all&hellip; but said that they did.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/nothing_else_matters/">
            <p class="note title">Nothing Else Matters</p><p class="note date">2009-12-05</p><p class="note content">Not long ago Mogg mentioned listening to Apocalyptica, a band consisting of a classical string instruments (bass, cello) plus drums whose music is covers of metal classics and much of their own material. This group came up on Pandora a few times for me as well, and I really enjoyed them, so finally I started listening more seriously.
One of the first pieces I recognized was a cover of Nothing Else Matters by Metallica; one I think we&rsquo;re all familiar with.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/us_broadband/">
            <p class="note title">US Broadband</p><p class="note date">2009-10-30</p><p class="note content">Not long ago I came across and article that mentioned the National Broadband Network or NBN. This is a government effort in Australia to bring 100Mb/s to 90% of the country/continent&rsquo;s population.
Personally, I&rsquo;m almost unilaterally in favor of any government measure that keeps technology rolling forward. The biggest criticism for this project is that the Aussie government is spending about $43 billion dollars on it. With 8 million residents, that&rsquo;s about $5,000 being spent per household.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/thief_meets_doom/">
            <p class="note title">Thief Meets Doom</p><p class="note date">2009-10-13</p><p class="note content">This is more for Mogg than the rest of you I think, but here we go anyway. Some clowns have been working on a Thief mod for Doom 3 for 5 years, and it just went into &ldquo;beta&rdquo;. I know we&rsquo;ve got a long list of games to play already, practically one coming out each week until Christmas, but it might be worth checking out afterward.

            <p class="note title">ODST Review</p><p class="note date">2009-10-13</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m tempted to bring the full balls-to-the-wall hatefest for this but really I just can&rsquo;t make myself care enough to get riled up. It&rsquo;s more Halo, and you&rsquo;ve seen what Halo is. There is nothing to be said for graphics, sound and gameplay that you haven&rsquo;t already been exposed to.
New weapons: a flamethrower and a silenced SMG. You see the flamethrower in one mission, and there is only one of them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/metarpg_update/">
            <p class="note title">MetaRPG Update</p><p class="note date">2009-10-04</p><p class="note content">Just wanted to update you guys on MetaRPG development. The stat window is near completion, at least for my initial design goals. The main difference from OpenRPG&rsquo;s stat window is a lack of &ldquo;container&rdquo; objects, and all dice rolls and such are represented as python objects rather than a formatted string that is processed.
Recall that in OpenRPG you could type [1d20+2] and that would roll a die for you. When I write the chat window code I intend to have that kind of processing but not in how a stat (or full character sheet) is defined in the stat window.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/9/">
            <p class="note title">9</p><p class="note date">2009-09-29</p><p class="note content">I just saw 9 with Liz, and discovered that it is one of those movies I wish I first saw with you guys (and with Liz). From start to finish this movie is incredibly imaginative, filled with silent commentary about what humanity is, and displayed with the creepiness of Tim Burton at his finest.
Fantastic movie: 10/10. I&rsquo;m usually conservative with perfect reviews, and I hope the fact that I raved about District 9 only a few months ago doesn&rsquo;t dilute this recommendation.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/game_atmosphere_case_study/">
            <p class="note title">Game Atmosphere Case Study</p><p class="note date">2009-09-18</p><p class="note content">Many of us carry on about current generation games failing to provide an immersive setting or atmosphere, despite improvements in graphics, sound, and gameplay. While there may be something to be said about our long experience playing video games, perhaps related to desensitization, I would like to offer a study on a game I&rsquo;ve been (re-)playing lately that continues to deliver a compelling atmospheric gaming experience: STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. (SoC)<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/awards/">
            <p class="note title">Awards</p><p class="note date">2009-09-03</p><p class="note content">These are the Awards available to win, as far as I can remember. Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. Originally we had a clear list, but over time other character flaws that were more regularly expressed might have become what the Award was associated with.
 Mogg Award: Being a tool. A slave to any authority such as work, your wife, or other responsibilities your friends believe to not be worth your time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/wolfenstein/">
            <p class="note title">Wolfenstein</p><p class="note date">2009-08-30</p><p class="note content">I just finished the new Wolfenstein that was released 2 weeks ago. This will be a favorable review, so lets start with the bad stuff.
 Grunt nazis can be a little brain-dead at times. On more than one occasion I&rsquo;d be fighting a squad of them, and one-by-one they&rsquo;d suddenly come barreling around the corner into my gunfire. They can also be a little predictable with the cover and gun-emplacements they&rsquo;ll choose to use.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

            <p class="note title">AWS Re:Invent and DevOps</p><p class="note date">2012-12-15</p><p class="note content">2 weeks ago I was in Las Vegas attending AWS re:Invent. Amazon Web Services is the group responsible for EC2, S3, and other cloud-computing tech and services, they are a part of Amazon.com, the online retailer I&rsquo;m sure you know. One interesting factoid they touted frequently was that every day, they add the same amount of hardware and infrastructure Amazon.com had in 2003 to their datacenters. This is the first re:Invent, and it had over 5,000 attendees.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/xenoblade_chronicles/">
            <p class="note title">Xenoblade Chronicles</p><p class="note date">2012-11-11</p><p class="note content">I picked this game up because I was curious about how the Japanese Role Playing Game (JRPG) genre has changed since I last played a game belonging to one. The last one I played I think is Final Fantasy 9. It&rsquo;s been a while. I put in 150+ hours into this game.
Xenoblade Chronicles (XC) squarely belongs in this genre, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in their right mind would disagree with that.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/hoover_dam/">
            <p class="note title">Hoover Dam</p><p class="note date">2012-09-15</p><p class="note content">While DefCon was going on we made a side trip to tour the Hoover Dam. I finally got around to sharing the pictures, enjoy!</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/selling_exploits/">
            <p class="note title">Selling Exploits</p><p class="note date">2012-09-11</p><p class="note content">ThreatPost has an interesting pocast that features Chris Soghoian talking about the sale of software exploits. This has been going on for years, but it&rsquo;s growing into more of an &ldquo;open secret&rdquo;, according to him. They know what they&rsquo;re doing and are ok with having invite-only parties at public events like DefCon or BlackHat.
The SciFi-Cyberpunk nerd in me thinks it is awesome that this is a thing that exists in our world.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/half-life_throwback/">
            <p class="note title">Half-Life Throwback</p><p class="note date">2012-09-03</p><p class="note content">Sans-Serif just got a new computer, and I spent Labor Day playing Half Life 2 mods, so I figured a post about the best of them was in order.
The first one I cannot recommend enough is Mission Improbable. It&rsquo;s a few hours long, looks fantastic, and easily mistaken for a professional project; it requires Episode 2.
The second was Minerva: Metastasis(see link at the bottom) which was also great, but had a few glitches to note: the waves surrounding the island were a little &ldquo;off&rdquo;, and I had a few crashes in the second half of the first chapter.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/12_tops/">
            <p class="note title">12 Tops</p><p class="note date">2012-08-26</p><p class="note content">The 12 Tops Encyclopedia is back up, now running on OpenShift. For now, OpenShift is free, and there will always be a free tier, but eventually heavy users of the service will be charged. I don&rsquo;t expect that to be us. I plan to move Prithivaand the main Brolem site there too.
Here&rsquo;s how I completed the migration. If you want your own hosted MediaWiki (or whatever else), give OpenShift a try.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/clouds/">
            <p class="note title">Clouds</p><p class="note date">2012-08-25</p><p class="note content">While I&rsquo;m sure everyone here is aware of &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; being used to describe online services, or rebrand existing products, not all of it is marketing fluff. There still is a lot of ambiguity, and a few companies set out to define the term themselves rather than repeat the same blather. Three service models have arrived from those efforts which I will attempt to explain here. Wikipedia predictably has a good article on the subject too, but it is laden with computer jargon that may be difficult for non-technical people to parse&hellip; err&hellip; understand.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/vegas_vacation/">
            <p class="note title">Vegas Vacation</p><p class="note date">2012-07-31</p><p class="note content">The last 5 days I have been in Las Vegas, and it is good to be home again. Originally the plan was David Cantrelland I would attend DefCon 20together, but then our wives wanted to come, and naturally Chris Lumensand his wife found good reasons to be there too: hiking in the mountains. DefCon only lasted 3 days, but we made a group vacation out of it by adding a couple more.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/dungeon_the_odious_ossuary/">
            <p class="note title">Dungeon: The Odious Ossuary</p><p class="note date">2012-07-16</p><p class="note content">Recently the players of 3.5 edition D&amp;D campaign setting completed an extensive dungeon. I cannot say is is the largest one I have done, but it certainly ranks up there. It took 4 sessions to complete (2 of them were only 3 hours long) and is meant for a group of 5-6 5th level players.
The background is archived here. As a stand-alone module, the key mechanic are the Vengeful Encounters, certain triggers will start one.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/diablo_3/">
            <p class="note title">Diablo 3</p><p class="note date">2012-06-09</p><p class="note content">There&rsquo;s not much I can say about Diablo 3 that has not already been said. I recognize that the game already sold a bazillion copies, and there&rsquo;s little gamers can do to change the direction of the industries momentum into a connected, always-online model.
For me personally though, the sense of possession some people have on software still feels misguided. Perhaps my employment with a company that professionally involves developing software you can get for free has something to do with it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

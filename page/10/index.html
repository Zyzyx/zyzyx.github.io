            <p class="note title">Dirty Coding</p><p class="note date">2010-10-23</p><p class="note content">Recently I came into possession of the sources for Agobot3, the parent of many modern worms that join grandma&rsquo;s computer to botnets. I&rsquo;ve been studying the code a bit and found a couple blocks I found rather interesting.
Notably, Agobot3 has code in it to detect if it is being run in a debugger. This is specifically to make reverse engineering it harder for the security community. Now that the sources are out it&rsquo;s rather moot, but still worth walking through for the sake of learning.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/horror_mechanics_in_amnesia_tdd/">
            <p class="note title">Horror Mechanics in Amnesia: TDD</p><p class="note date">2010-10-18</p><p class="note content">A few weeks ago I completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a survival horror game that does an excellent job with the horror part. This will be an incomplete review, focusing specifically on the game mechanics that make it work. Frankly I&rsquo;m surprised more games are not like this one, which I do recommend strongly by the way.
First of all, the game is well paced and makes impressive use of sound, light, and atmosphere.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/the_witcher/">
            <p class="note title">The Witcher</p><p class="note date">2010-10-18</p><p class="note content">Yesterday I finished The Witcher, a lengthy and largely successful RPG. As far as modern RPGs go, this one delivers well: you develop some interest in the characters, the setting, and the plot. There is a lot to like about this game, and some to dislike. I&rsquo;ll begin with what detracted from the experience for me, since according to some, finishing a criticism favorably more likely convinces an audience that the review was favorable.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/bioshock_infinite/">
            <p class="note title">Bioshock: Infinite</p><p class="note date">2010-09-22</p><p class="note content">Mogg recently brought my attention to Bioshock Infinite, a game I have a skeptical view of. Before continuing with this post, I highly recommend you read an interview with Ken Levine and one with Timothy Gerritson. There is a game-play video as well. Well, sort of a game-play video. Ok, not really, but it is still cool to watch.
After reading Levine&rsquo;s interview, I had renewed interested in the franchise. The most interesting thing in Bioshock for me was not the plot, not the gameplay, but the setting.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/nehrim/">
            <p class="note title">Nehrim</p><p class="note date">2010-09-21</p><p class="note content">Last week I started playing Nehrim, a total conversion mod for Oblivion. It features new art, music, monsters, items, dungeons, terrain&hellip; pretty much everything. It is completely distinct from Oblivion; it shares the same engine and a few art assets, the similarities end there. So far I have dropped about 20 hours into it, with no end in sight. To understand what I like about Nehrim, I have to begin with what I didn&rsquo;t like about Oblivion: character progression was unrewarding and repetitive.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/game_creative_direction_case_study/">
            <p class="note title">Game Creative Direction Case Study</p><p class="note date">2010-09-14</p><p class="note content">I recently had the pleasure of completing Psychonauts, a game I should have played a long time ago. There is little novelty in terms of game-play here: it&rsquo;s 3rd person, you run around and collect stuff to unlock additional levels. As you progress you learn new psychic powers, and you can &ldquo;equip&rdquo; them using an interface players of the more recent Zelda installments will quickly recognize. There is some humor in the dialog and plot which is entertaining too.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/honeymoon_monteverde/">
            <p class="note title">Honeymoon: Monteverde</p><p class="note date">2010-08-22</p><p class="note content">Our last stop was Monteverde, the &ldquo;Cloud Forest&rdquo;. So named because of the elevation, the mountain tops are over the cloud cover, resulting in forestry that is frequently enshrouded by clouds. The climate here was a welcome change: 70s and much lower humidity. The resort we stayed at was called El Establo.
Like Arenal this part of our trip was dominated by tours and hikes into the forest: butterfly gardens, hummingbird gardens, and more hanging bridges.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/music_library_tools_part_2_setting_id3_tags/">
            <p class="note title">Music Library Tools Part 2: Setting ID3 Tags</p><p class="note date">2010-08-19</p><p class="note content">Update: I&rsquo;ve made quite a few enhancements to the script:
Smarter Renaming Tags Ogg-vorbis files Tags FLAC files Handles a few more genres  ID3 tags are bits of data encoded in an mp3 file that catalogue the artist, album, year, genre, song title and other fields of metadata that explain what an mp3 is. On linux, you can manipulate these fields using the id3v2 command line utility. It&rsquo;s important to use version 2 of the ID3 tag specification because modern players skip any tagging done with version 1.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/honeymoon_arenal/">
            <p class="note title">Honeymoon: Arenal</p><p class="note date">2010-08-19</p><p class="note content">Our second stop was Arenal. There are 112 volcanoes in Costa Rica, only 7 of which are active, and only one of which has the characteristic cone-shape. Arenal erupted in 1968, leveling a town and killing 65 people. It erupted again in 1992, with 5 injured.
Today it erupts fairly frequently, but they&rsquo;re small and harmless. It erupted 3 times while we were watching: twice at night and once during the day.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/honeymoon_tortuguero/">
            <p class="note title">Honeymoon: Tortuguero</p><p class="note date">2010-08-18</p><p class="note content">We began our eco-touring in one of the wettest parts of the country: Tortuguero. We knew we were getting remote when we had to take a river boat up a river for an hour and half to reach the lodge. It is not possible to reach it on foot (for the average person), let alone a car. First we all climbed into a bus and headed to the Rio Dante: a small open-air restaurant on the outskirts of the reserve.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

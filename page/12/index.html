            <p class="note title">Good Evening from Herzliya</p><p class="note date">2010-02-06</p><p class="note content">Good evening from Herzliya! We (a coworker and I) landed at 3pm today, which is 8am your time. I have to say so far the place is great, much nicer than expected. It&rsquo;s like a city in southern California with all signs in Hebrew. Our hotel is on the Mediterranean beach, and we&rsquo;ve been to two bars and a seafood restaurant. I&rsquo;ll have pictures up as the trip goes on. For now though, I really feel like I need to sleep.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/more_metarpg_progress/">
            <p class="note title">More MetaRPG Progress</p><p class="note date">2010-02-02</p><p class="note content">Work continues on MetaRPG. Do those stats on the left in the screenshot look familiar? I took the program through a real use case tonight: building a 4th edition character sheet template. I thought of a few usability improvements on the way but the core functionality felt complete. Chat works too, although only if you want to talk to yourself. The purple text near the bottom are hotlinks: similar to linking items in WoW you can link items or skills (or anything really) into text so others can mouse over and see the stats.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/3_challenges_for_illinoise/">
            <p class="note title">3 Challenges for Illinoise</p><p class="note date">2010-01-27</p><p class="note content">Complete World 5.2 of Demon&rsquo;s Souls. This level is entirely poisonous, and even the creators admit difficulty completing it. Do this, and I will value your opinion on games higher than my own. Please take a moment and think about the implications. You could say Bayonetta is a fabulous game, and I would be forced to acquiesce to your better judgement. If you can successfully hack Brolem.net, feel free to be liberal with your new-found privileges, but please don&rsquo;t ruin it beyond repair.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/gource/">
            <p class="note title">Gource</p><p class="note date">2010-01-27</p><p class="note content">This post has a youtube link below that I need to explain before you click on it. It does not involve cats, yelling, dubbing over star trek, griefing in Second Life, crying teens, shitting on someone&rsquo;s porch, Jackass-quality stunts, violence, anal sex, awful mashups, or Halo headshots. So basically nobody is going to give a shit about it except me.
It was generated using Gource, a program that takes the commit logs of an SCM and generates a visualization of activity over a given people of time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/cold_brewed_coffee/">
            <p class="note title">Cold Brewed Coffee</p><p class="note date">2010-01-27</p><p class="note content">A co-worker of mine was sharing this secret the other day. Coffee without the characteristic bitterness. Extraordinarily smooth. Even Liz could drink it black. Follow these instructions to enjoy it yourself:
 Buy this. Sorry, few things are free. Put a pound of coarse-grind coffee in the bottom vessel. Fill the top vessel with room-temperature water (or cold, whatever), and let the unit sit for 12-24 hours. By the next day you&rsquo;ll have a coffee concentrate.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/machinarium/">
            <p class="note title">Machinarium</p><p class="note date">2010-01-27</p><p class="note content">Turns out I have a free night tonight so I can finally put down a few posts that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to for several days.
I&rsquo;ll start with a review of Machinarium. This is, literally, a point-and-click adventure game written in Flash. P-n-C games were popular in the early nineties, you rarely see these at all any more with today&rsquo;s graphics but this one was surprisingly good. It&rsquo;s only $10 that you can download from their site easily (and legitimately).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/transcoding/">
            <p class="note title">Transcoding</p><p class="note date">2010-01-17</p><p class="note content">Been messing with HandBrake a lot lately to transcode the majority of my movie/anime library into an encoding the xbox360 can understand. It&rsquo;s a great program; very easy to use thanks to &ldquo;presets&rdquo;, a set of configuration options to the encoder and muxer to encode the video the way you want. It understands pretty much any format, including straight DVD rips, but with the latest version it only outputs to a few modern formats.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/ushare/">
            <p class="note title">uShare</p><p class="note date">2009-12-16</p><p class="note content">Illinoise inspired me while I was home for the holidays: via TVersity he is able to play media from his desktop that is sitting in his room upstairs on his PS3. I wanted to do something similar, but TVersity is Windows-only which is unacceptable. I did get uShare working on mine though, which provides a Universal Plug aNd Play server that xbox360s can identify on the network.
uShare is very lightweight, and like any good linux tool, console-driven.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/healthcare_today/">
            <p class="note title">Healthcare Today</p><p class="note date">2009-12-16</p><p class="note content">If you&rsquo;re like me, you have an opinion on the state of health care and how to reform it, but not one informed well enough that you&rsquo;re comfortable with being regularly vocal about it. If you&rsquo;re not like me, get a job. Anyway, to assist with getting an informed opinion you are willing to share with others, I&rsquo;ve enclosed a series of podcasts from npr.org that really helped me understand how things are today.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/ink/">
            <p class="note title">Ink</p><p class="note date">2009-12-09</p><p class="note content">I can&rsquo;t remember if one of you guys recommended this, but I just saw Ink via Netflix. It&rsquo;s an indie movie, so expect something unusual when you&rsquo;re watching it. It&rsquo;s also a mind trip, so be in a good mental state too if you want to have any chance of understanding it on deeper levels.
Anyway I found it to be very enjoyable and recommend it.</p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

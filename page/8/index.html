            <p class="note title">The Deep End</p><p class="note date">2011-05-31</p><p class="note content">I spent much of my 3 day weekend investigating a network traffic dump from a system that got infected with malware. It comes from challenge #6 on Honeynet.org, an interesting site that if you&rsquo;ve got time and persistence, you can really teach yourself a lot about computer security and attacks.
What you start with is a pcap file, which is a file format that contains network traffic dumps (collections of packets) that can be read by traffic analysis programs.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fedora_15/">

The interesting features for me are systemd and Gnome 3. I may update this weekend on the laptop</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/freelancer/">
            <p class="note title">Freelancer</p><p class="note date">2011-05-17</p><p class="note content">Sans&rsquo; mention of a Freelancer emulator on Linux (which I could not find) motivated me to setting up a Freelancer server. On Windows 7 after quite a bit of mod/patch downloads, I was able to set up a server and connect to it myself. The procedure I followed was:
 Install Freelancer Download and install the 1.1 patch by running the executable (Optional) Download the no-CD &ldquo;patch&rdquo; and overwriting the Freelancer EXE file Download and install the Freelancer Mod Manager (FLMM) by running the executable.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/boolean_mechanics_in_games/">
            <p class="note title">Boolean Mechanics in Games</p><p class="note date">2011-05-08</p><p class="note content">In the original Fallout games there were a handful of skills you could use as a player that produced a pass or fail result; you either succeeded or you did not. An example would be using your Science skill to hack a computer. If you successfully made whatever the roll was, you would hack it, and something would happen. If you failed, nothing would happen. Lockpicking is another example. At times there were critical failures, but for the sake of argument I&rsquo;m going to ignore those because all they meant was you could not try again for a long period of time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/koji/">
            <p class="note title">Koji</p><p class="note date">2011-05-04</p><p class="note content">One of my job functions at work is to maintain and extend our build system. This affords us a couple benefits: one central location to find package and product builds (which is good when multiple teams need to work together for integration tasks), and a repeatable workflow that product groups are familiar with across the company.
Internally, we developed a system that served well for a couple years. After a lot of debate with a few executives, we eventually open sourced this system, calling it Koji.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/goodbye_aim/">

After reviewing my buddy list, everyone on it that I&rsquo;m still interested in talking to has an alternate means of reaching me. I&rsquo;ve used this account since 9th grade.
Most friends and family reach me on gchat, which is preferred. You can find me on freenode IRC as well as jgreguske (which is registered) or zyzyx (which is not).</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/crysis_2/">
            <p class="note title">Crysis 2</p><p class="note date">2011-04-16</p><p class="note content">Last night I finished Crysis 2, the prettiest game to date. I will not spend more than 2 sentences prattling on about the graphics, but I must say that this game looks better and runs better than games that look worse; Crytek knows out optimize rendering code.
You play a guy in a high tech suit that has super powers: Predator-style stealth, super strength, infra-red vision and armor to stop bullets.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/metarpg_0%2e3%2e0/">
            <p class="note title">MetaRPG 0.3.0</p><p class="note date">2011-04-16</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;ve been putting off the Windows port for quite a while, and the reason is because I&rsquo;ve been watching two technologies grow before pursuing one.
The first is PyGObject, which is a feature of GNOME 3. If I go this route, MetaRPG should be Python and PyGTK-agnostic, meaning you can install any modern versions of these dependencies and it should work just fine. The MetaRPG user experience would not change much; it would make bundling Python and PyGTK with MetaRPG easier though, and it makes development easier in the future.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/iain_m%2e_banks/">

In this post I will be intentionally be vague so I don&rsquo;t give too much away. It is important to understand that you don&rsquo;t learn everything you need to know about the Culture in the first book, you learn a little more with each one.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/rhce/">

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>I started with a 2 year stint at <a href="https://www.hp.com"target="_blank">HP</a> as a software developer, got laid off, and have worked at <a href="https://wwww.redhat.com"target="_blank">Red Hat, Inc.</a> ever since. It&rsquo;s been good, I&rsquo;m not actively looking for a new job. <a href="https://www.ibm.com"target="_blank">IBM</a> continues to behave like an ally too, which is encouraging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been about 11 years now; the first few years I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_engineering"target="_blank">release engineer</a>, eventually became a technical lead for the team, then the lead for a team of teams. A few years ago I branched out into more &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform"target="_blank">low code</a>&rdquo; roles: program manager, architect, business analyst, and later portfolio management.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m a Senior Principal Software Engineer. I work with a (mostly) hand-picked team of directors, architects, and portfolio managers to manage the direction of a 400+ person department. The Enterprise Experience and Delivery (EXD) department is responsible for a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintaining and extending <a href="https://access.redhat.com"target="_blank">Red Hat&rsquo;s Customer Portal</a></li>
<li>maintaining and building out the services Engineering uses to manufacture and deliver software products (build systems, delivery systems, etc)</li>
<li>a deployment of Open Hybrid Cloud infrastructure available to host any tools and services Engineering needs to do their job</li>
</ul>
<p>In many ways, we&rsquo;re a branch of IT that provides both developer playgrounds and mission critical services. My job experience has made me a swiss-army knife in this industry and I continue to drive Red Hat&rsquo;s use of software technology, manufacturing process, and portfolio management every day.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.anselm.edu/faculty-directory/elizabeth-greguske"target="_blank">wife</a> with 2 kids. A few nights out of the week I&rsquo;m usually practicing on the drum kit, playing D&amp;D, playing video games with friends online, or painting miniatures. Prior to raising kids I also played Ultimate (frisbee) and paintball.</p>
<p>I have traveled to Europe many times for fun and business. I&rsquo;ve been to England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Israel. Prior to the pandemic, I would be at a loud metal concert once a quarter. The only fest I&rsquo;ve been to is <a href="https://aftershockfestival.com/"target="_blank">Aftershock</a>, and that was a blast.</p>
<h2 id="bucket-list">Bucket List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Win a CTF competition (in Computer Security)</li>
<li>Learn a 2nd language</li>
<li>Run a 1-20 level D&amp;D campaign</li>
<li>Retire while I am still capable of traveling around the world</li>
<li>Raise these kids to be productive members of human society</li>
</ul>

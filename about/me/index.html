<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>I started with a 2 year stint at <a href="https://www.hp.com/">HP</a> as a software developer, got laid off, and have worked at <a href="https://wwww.redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.</a> ever since. It’s been good; I’m not actively looking for a new job. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> acquired us a few years ago and continues to behave like an ally too, which is encouraging.</p>
<p>It’s been 14 years now. My job experience has made me a swiss-army knife in this industry and I continue to drive Red Hat’s use of software technology, manufacturing process, and portfolio management every day. There are two achievements I am especially proud of while working at this company: defining the <em>Product Pipeline</em>, and defining how to track work and deliverables across Engineering.</p>
<h3 id="defining-red-hats-product-pipeline">Defining Red Hat&rsquo;s Product Pipeline</h3>
<p>What we know as the Product Pipeline today (or “release train”) began as a spreadsheet I put together capturing all running applications and services used to ship bits from upstream, through Red Hat, and out to customers on our public internet properties.  I identified the owners of those services, performed a risk assessment on them, and recommended next steps to turn it into a more robust and complete function.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, the services were disparate and owned by separate organizations across the company. The tools all had separate priority lists and stakeholders.  Getting anything done holistically was nearly impossible, and usually work was only done for Enterprise Linux (RHEL) because they had the most clout.  Other products rarely had a chance to see real change for their benefit.</p>
<p>After identifying the necessary services to maintain, the top business function for our department became clear: support the build and delivery of products.  However, we were not organizationally optimized to perform that function.  It was re-org time for a ~180 person organization.  Together with 3 other directors, we laid out the foundation for what was to become Software Production.  Rather than being arranged by function, the organization was arranged by technology area: RHEL (Platform), OpenShift (Cloud), and Middleware (Management).  Once that had landed I served as the architect and product owner for the way Red Hat builds and releases on-premise software to customers, governing the development direction of more than 100 applications and services.</p>
<p>We had completed a transformation from a disparate pile of services that release engineers had to dynamically stitch together for each product, to a single organization that maintained and designed Red Hat’s software manufacturing systems from beginning to end. Much of my time was spent decommissioning legacy services and home-grown solutions, pivoting users toward more sustainable solutions and investments. Toward the end of this chapter in my career I delegated my architectural responsibilities to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralphbean?original_referer=">Ralph Bean</a>, and my product ownership to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bonnet-rh/en?trk=people-guest_people_search-card">Mike Bonnet</a>.  Together we managed projects and programs around the services we maintained, and they needed to be tied with other efforts around engineering.  Our work was all tracked in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, but unfortunately the rest of engineering’s work was in many different trackers with varying levels of capability.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-red-hats-work-tracking-capabilities">Optimizing Red Hat&rsquo;s Work Tracking Capabilities</h3>
<p>I decided that Jira was going to be the work tracker for Red Hat products going forward, and designed a container-based architecture for a Data Center instance of Atlassian’s product running on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/dedicated">OpenShift Dedicated</a>.  We consolidated 4 other Jira instances to <a href="https://issues.redhat.com">that instance</a>. Prior to the consolidation I rebooted a working group into the Opinionated Jira &amp; Agile group (OJA), and set out to define standards for what configurations would be permissible in our instance.</p>
<p>This working group at its peak had representation from two dozen different organizations and all engineering technology areas.  Together we defined catalogs of configuration options, balancing teams’ desires for flexibility to self optimize with program and portfolio managements’ desire to standardize for the sake of reporting and status roll ups.  As of March 7th, 2023, more than 60% of the 1,400+ active projects in the instance are on standardized schemes. Our goal continues to be over 80% by this summer; an incalculable amount of legacy and organic customization was cut from this instance.</p>
<p>While standardizing how work was to be tracked a promise was routinely made: this would enable Red Hat to model the company’s incremental investments and overall portfolio strategy in one place. Together with passionate people from a variety of technology areas, I kicked off a new (internal) community interested in modeling Red Hat’s strategic direction in Jira. It designs processes and provides recommendations to enable important insights engineering deliverables. This will be the cherry on Red Hat’s work tracking sundae.</p>
<p>Around this time my daily work made me a better fit for a different department since I wasn&rsquo;t managing how products were built and released any more. With my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-phillips-3586574">new manager</a>, I continue to mediate the balance between <a href="https://www.wrike.com/agile-guide/faq/what-is-an-agile-practitioner/">agile practitioners</a> that want maximal flexibility to optimize their team(s), and program/project/portfolio managers that want standards so they can do their job with stellar reporting.  I had been working closely with this organization already because of OJA, and gained the insight that they would be going through a very similar reorganization effort that my previous department had.  I signed on to continue OJA’s mission, but also consult on organizational matters and evangelize their transformation to a new engagement model. This continues today; the organizational changes have completed but there is still much to do from a work culture and execution standpoint.</p>
<h3 id="how-others-see-me">How Others See Me</h3>
<p>My superiors might describe me as a swiss-army knife engineer with an unusual amount of on-the-job experience in organizational design and process definition.  At a technical level, my skill set is very broad due to developing and maintaining systems in our product pipeline, designing a container-based solution with Jira, and maintaining that solution as a business critical application on OpenShift Dedicated.  I have mastered how to build communities, consensus, and roll out significant changes across large organizations. Senior managers and directors seek advice from me on this topic.  My ability to navigate contentious topics with stakeholders that have conflicting interests earned me the <a href="https://www.credly.com/org/red-hat-inc/badge/red-hat-general-h-hugh-shelton-chairman-s-award-winner">Chairman’s award</a> in 2022.  All of my tenure at Red Hat has been in organizations with contested backlogs and priorities; making tradeoffs and decommissioning services comes naturally to me.</p>
<p>My peers see me as the organization’s change agent and evangelist, driving a continuous desire to improve, uproot stagnant processes, and decommission systems that should have died a long time ago.  They hear about me constantly from their subordinates; conversations that are a byproduct of the wakes and ripples I leave behind interacting with their teams.  I enjoy the challenge of opening people up to imagining environments where they no longer have some long-standing endemic problem or team inefficiency.  Those types of (internal) problems I have a habit of seeking and analyzing for replacement.</p>
<p>These days I lend my experience with others to decommission services, and get better at “saying no” when appropriate. I find that jettisoning legacy can be a harder problem space than inventing new technologies in a green field. Challenges in this space are what I like to overcome with a team.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.anselm.edu/faculty-directory/elizabeth-greguske">wife</a> with 2 kids. On a given night of the work week I’m usually practicing on the drum kit, playing board games or videos games online, maintaining a <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyberpunk-red-core">Cyberpunk Red system</a> for <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">FoundryVTT</a>, or painting miniatures. Prior to raising kids I also played a lot of Ultimate (frisbee) and paintball.</p>
<p>I have traveled to Europe many times for fun and business. I’ve been to England, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Israel. Prior to the pandemic, I would be at a loud metal concert once a quarter. The only fest I’ve been to is Aftershock, and that was a blast.</p>
<h3 id="bucket-list">Bucket List</h3>
<ul>
<li><del>Run a 1-20 level D&amp;D campaign</del></li>
<li>Compose 5 unique drum solos that are not terrible</li>

      <description>All opinons here are my own, not my employer or any other organization cited here.
Career I started with a 2 year stint at HP as a software developer, got laid off, and have worked at Red Hat, Inc. ever since. It&amp;rsquo;s been good, I&amp;rsquo;m not actively looking for a new job. IBM continues to behave like an ally too, which is encouraging.
It&amp;rsquo;s been about 11 years now; the first few years I was a release engineer, eventually became a technical lead for the team, then the lead for a team of teams.</description>

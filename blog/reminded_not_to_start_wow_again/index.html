    <h1 class="article title">Reminded Not to Start WoW Again</h1><p class="article date">2009-08-12</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>From the 3.2.2 patch notes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has lurked in her lair and done battle with the many brave adventurers who travelled to that familiar location over the years. Now, in honor of the World of Warcraft 5-year anniversary, the dreaded brood mother Onyxia is being revamped to make a return to the forefront of Azeroth, as part of our big plans for the upcoming 3.2.2 content patch.</p>
<p>This permanent update to Onyxia will convert the dungeon into 10- and 25-player modes. We will be adding new items to Onyxia’s loot table that have the same model as some of the classic loot from this dungeon, like Tier 2 helms, with stats updated to match the current level of content. There will be a special new item too: a normal drake-sized 310% speed flying mount modeled after Onyxia herself called an Onyxia Broodling. We will also be updating the encounter mechanics to be more fitting for modern raiding, but we can guarantee players will get to experience the frightening horror of deep breaths once again.</p>
<p>Then for a limited time, after the 5-year anniversary event officially begins in November, anybody who logs in will receive an Onyxia Brood Whelpling pet.</p>
<p>We’re very excited to bring this classic encounter back to provide a fun new experience for both new and veteran players. Further details will be available in the near future, and we will be setting up the Public Test Realms soon to help test out this fight along with all the new content we have planned for the patch. Keep an eye on the forums for updates!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played, they&rsquo;re talking about an encounter that has been in the game since the beginning and redesigning it for the higher levels players can get to today.</p>
<p>I saw this on my guild&rsquo;s site first, and I was strongly tempted to post something to the effect of, &ldquo;You know I needed a reminder not to start playing again, I&rsquo;m glad I found one&rdquo;, but I decided they didn&rsquo;t really need to hear that. Besides many of them started the game late and really didn&rsquo;t see it, so it would be new to them anyway.</p>
<p>But still, I feel like I&rsquo;m alone in realizing it&rsquo;s still the same stuff over and over again, and people find reasons to like it. And I completely understand how, because it isn&rsquo;t about the content, it&rsquo;s about reliving past experiences with your friends and eFriends. And while I do have lots folks that would be excited and warmed at my return, I just can&rsquo;t get myself to be interested because I&rsquo;m so sick of it. I wonder if it&rsquo;s because I value game content more than the social aspect of an MMO, or for some other reason.</p>
<p>Or because I don&rsquo;t have a working gaming computer. (I can still stage site content on it though)</p>
<p>I have been checking up on the guild occasionally to see how they are doing. Occasionally I did get pangs to play again. But they recently switched guild masters, my successor has now retired. And oddly enough the way that affects me is that I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to watch their progress anymore. Promoting him was my last decision as guild master, and perhaps the one with the greatest impact on the guild: even more than trying to merge it with another guild to keep raiding going. When he screwed up, I felt partly responsible and tried to smooth things over, often to the detriment of the relationship he and I had. When he did well, I felt empowered vicariously through him.</p>
<p>But now that&rsquo;s gone, and everything truly feels out of my hands now. I think I&rsquo;m really over it.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Game Creative Direction Case Study</h1><p class="article date">2010-09-14</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>I recently had the pleasure of completing Psychonauts, a game I should have played a long time ago. There is little novelty in terms of game-play here: it&rsquo;s 3rd person, you run around and collect stuff to unlock additional levels. As you progress you learn new psychic powers, and you can &ldquo;equip&rdquo; them using an interface players of the more recent Zelda installments will quickly recognize. There is some humor in the dialog and plot which is entertaining too. This is a T rated game for PC and Classic XBox, and much of the art direction has a cartoony spin; imagine a Tim Burton rendition of Team Fortress 2. (minus excessive and unnecessary camera time for Johnny Depp)</p>
<p>Many spoilers ahead!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the premise, Psychonauts takes place in a world where people can psychically invade others&rsquo; minds and wander around a world fabricated by their subconscious. There are several characters you invade&hellip; although &ldquo;invade&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right word because often they want you to go in and clean up their mental problems. Each character has some sort of neurosis you need to assist with. In the mind-worlds you&rsquo;ll find emotional baggage you have to collect and tag to sort things out, and by the end you&rsquo;ll fight some sort of boss, which is usually a personification of their mental illness.</p>
<p>If you pause for a moment and think about this, you&rsquo;ll realize this premise allows for very, very creative design. This game delivers that in spades. The level design is brilliantly done. Every level was a surprise, and when I was getting near the end of one I could not put down the controller before getting a glimpse of the next.</p>
<p>The characters you invade directly influence the art direction of the levels. The first level is in the mind of a drill sergeant, so the layout looks like a giant out-of-control obstacle course. The color palette is primarily browns, greys and olive drab; bullets whiz around, stuff is exploding frequently, and cast on several surfaces are projector screens showing (fake) World War 2 footage. However the small details in this level really did it for me: the bushes, if you look closely, are made of spent ammo casings, not leaves. Vines are barbwire, harmless small animals have tiny army helmets on, and bridges are made of used target dummies.</p>
<p>Another character is a Spanish romantic bull fighter struggling to remember how to paint. The art direction for this level is excellent: the color use makes it look like you&rsquo;re running around in a Black Velvet painting. A more complete description of the level is here. My favorite level takes place in the mind of a paranoid milkman; his level appears to be a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; looking neighborhood, but every window has a pair of eyes looking out of them, and various parts of the scenery (fire hydrants, lawn ornaments) open up to quickly reveal a camera that takes a picture of you. The final world takes place when your psyche begins to mesh with the villains, and both of your repressed memories of your father begin to mingle. Your father was a circus acrobat, the villain&rsquo;s was a butcher; so the world you must navigate is the &ldquo;meat circus&rdquo;. Some parts of this scene are, dare I say, beyond the disturbia presented in Invader Zim.</p>
<p>I recommend this game. The creative direction is the best I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.</p>

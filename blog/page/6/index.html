            <p class="note title">American Craft Beer Fest</p><p class="note date">2012-06-05</p><p class="note content">Saturday I attended the ACBF, which was a great time. It was sort of a triple-date thing with 2 coworkers and their wives going as well. Between the three of us, we sampled about 10% of the beers available and 33% of the Brewers attending. A paltry ratio to be sure but you can only drink so much within a 4 hour period before getting ejected for obnoxious behavior. Each sample was a 2oz pour, which means by sample #38 I was getting myself in trouble.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fez/">
            <p class="note title">Fez</p><p class="note date">2012-05-08</p><p class="note content">Yes, that is the name, like the hat. I finished this game (full complete) about an hour ago.
Fez is an XBLA-only title that focuses puzzles and exploration above everything else. The core mechanic is exploiting your perspective of an apparently 2D world to make matter in 3D space line up the way you want, similar to Paper Mario or Echochrome. This gameplay video can do a far better job explaining than I can.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/mounted_tv/">
            <p class="note title">Mounted TV</p><p class="note date">2012-03-08</p><p class="note content">The first home-improvement project we had turned into a lengthy and rewarding father-son project. The goal was to mount our 42&rdquo; plasma above the fireplace; no wires showing afterward either. As you can see in the picture on the left, we were successful. Here is how that effort went.
Not long into our effort did we discover a critical problem. Above the fireplace there were no studs, just a trio of 2x8&rsquo;s that were rotated 90 degrees; e.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/house_wireless/">
            <p class="note title">House Wireless</p><p class="note date">2012-02-28</p><p class="note content">With a new house comes a new wireless network. We&rsquo;ve been frustrated with the Linksys WRT160N v2 we bought off the shelf at Best Buy. Once or twice every month Muffin would have to reset it to connect to the wireless (I blame Vista) and you could not install any custom firmware on it.
This time I did far more research, and landed with an Asus NT-16. I had been looking to find a router that fully supported TomatoUSB, open source router firmware that was recommended by a few coworkers.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/circuit_breakers/">
            <p class="note title">Circuit Breakers</p><p class="note date">2012-02-22</p><p class="note content">The first major home improvement I&rsquo;ve been up to lately is mounting the TV in the living room above the fireplace. That project is complete and I&rsquo;ll cover that in a future post, but one side quest that came up was adding another circuit to the circuit breaker so we could power it and add an outlet to the living room. This was enough of a side project that I felt it needed a separate post.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/zelda_skyward_sword_and_nintendo/">
            <p class="note title">Zelda: Skyward Sword and Nintendo</p><p class="note date">2012-02-21</p><p class="note content">This post contains a few spoilers.
I finished The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword yesterday evening. For once I nabbed all pieces of heart too.
The game is its usual charming self with bright colors and happy, aloof characters. It certainly still feels like a Zelda game, though it has the Windwakersort of overworld: instead of getting bored sailing around the ocean, you get bored flying around the sky. There are plenty of side quests to get better quivers, wallets, bomb bags, or pieces of heart; there&rsquo;s plenty to do, though not in the way of dungeons.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/follow_me_on_pandora/">
            <p class="note title">Follow Me on Pandora</p><p class="note date">2012-01-22</p><p class="note content">I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the extent of Pandora Radio had developed the social media part of their website until recently. Yesterday the Wife and I caught dinner at Teatrobefore catching a show in Boston, and they had a badass selection of chill break-beat pieces playing in the dining hall. I asked the hostess what was playing, and she replied they had found a Pandora station called &ldquo;The Dining Rooms&rdquo;.
Turns out The Dining Rooms is an artist, and a user had seeded their station with that artist and been sharing it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fudcon_2012/">
            <p class="note title">FUDCon 2012</p><p class="note date">2012-01-15</p><p class="note content">In a couple hours I&rsquo;ll be boarding flight 3959 to Charlotte from Roanoak, VA, and then flying to Manchester, NH from there. I spent this weekend and Friday at my second Fedora Users and Developers Conference. This year it was hosted at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.
Friday was pretty informal; I poked my head into several classrooms reserved for FUDCon and looked around to see if I knew anyone. I caught up with a couple folks that work on Anaconda, OpenShift, Pulp, Aeolus, Katelloand others that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m forgetting.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/achievement_unlocked_homeowner/">
            <p class="note title">Achievement Unlocked: Homeowner</p><p class="note date">2011-12-31</p><p class="note content">Yesterday we successfully closed on a house in NH. Now we begin the lengthy task of painting and decorating the thing. Afterward I discovered we live down the street from the chief of police, so there goes my hobby of building cannons for everyday objects like potatoes or soda cans. :(
Also, happy new year.</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/headphone_repair/">
            <p class="note title">Headphone Repair</p><p class="note date">2011-12-11</p><p class="note content">I own a set of Bose headphones that I&rsquo;ve had for about 3 to 4 years. At the time of purchase it was $160, and the current model available today is the AE2 They get my recommendation.
Unless you&rsquo;ve been giving them a hard life. I frequently brought them back and forth from home to work so I could listen to music, and the strain had finally worn through one of the wires near the connection in the left headphone.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

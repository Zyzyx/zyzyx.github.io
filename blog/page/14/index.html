            <p class="note title">Reminded Not to Start WoW Again</p><p class="note date">2009-08-12</p><p class="note content">From the 3.2.2 patch notes:
&ldquo;She has lurked in her lair and done battle with the many brave adventurers who travelled to that familiar location over the years. Now, in honor of the World of Warcraft 5-year anniversary, the dreaded brood mother Onyxia is being revamped to make a return to the forefront of Azeroth, as part of our big plans for the upcoming 3.2.2 content patch.
This permanent update to Onyxia will convert the dungeon into 10- and 25-player modes.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/game_forecast/">
            <p class="note title">Game Forecast</p><p class="note date">2009-08-08</p><p class="note content">Figured I&rsquo;d share a list of games I&rsquo;m interested coming up in the next 6 months. Watch out for noise and Flash-orgies in some of these links.
Borderlands on October 20th Starcraft 2 in the first half of 2010. Dragon-Age: Origins on November 3rd Bioshock 2 in the first half of 2010. See also this if you're an Invader Zim fan. Assassin's Creed 2 on November 17th Max Payne 3 this winter.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/pc_protip/">
            <p class="note title">PC ProTip</p><p class="note date">2009-08-06</p><p class="note content">Here&rsquo;s a little ProTip for those thinking about water cooling: (re)tighten the clamps after moving your computer around. Last week I smelled car coolant in the study, and few things will make me that anxious. Long story short, a clamp by the graphics card got loose and had a very slow leak. When I inspected it, the water had flowed around water block and had dripped down onto the case below.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/f%2ee%2ea%2er%2e_2_review/">
            <p class="note title">F.E.A.R. 2 Review</p><p class="note date">2009-08-05</p><p class="note content">Lets get right to the point: I wouldn&rsquo;t even use this piece of shit to bludgeon those bleeding heart assbags on Whale Wars to death. This is going to have a shit ton of spoilers so stop reading if you care. You shouldn&rsquo;t though if you still want to be my friend.
Ok, original story, lets be honest: pretty good. Believable if you&rsquo;re into Sci-Fi. (or SyFy if you&rsquo;re a colossal tool) Evil Corporation is creating any army of soldiers that don&rsquo;t question orders.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/defcon_part_3/">
            <p class="note title">DefCon (Part 3)</p><p class="note date">2009-08-03</p><p class="note content">DefCon is over, which is a sad thing since some shenanigans were just getting interesting. A couple of tweets like this one started rumors of a trojan on the DefCon CD, which turned out to be false. A few people were arrested on the roof of the Riviera; they got there after learning how to pick locks. And someone installed a fake ATM machine in the hotel.
Saturday night with Plake turned out to be a lot of fun.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/defcon_part_2/">
            <p class="note title">DefCon (Part 2)</p><p class="note date">2009-08-01</p><p class="note content">Another day down.
Talks attended:
(*** )Breaking the Unbreakable Oracle: New auxiliary module for metasploit to automate breaking into Oracle databases, and granting a given user DBA privs. (**** )Using Guided Missiles in Drive-bys: -1 for the title being misleading. This talk about fingerprinting a browser and launching targeted exploits (via metasploit) was pretty interesting. (** )Security risks of Web 2.0: Broad overview kind of thing, not too technical. My interest was to see if this site had any flaws I should know about, but that expectation was not met.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/defcon_part_1/">
            <p class="note title">DefCon (part 1)</p><p class="note date">2009-08-01</p><p class="note content">It&rsquo;s 7am and I&rsquo;m wide awake and ready for another day at DefCon 17. Well maybe that isn&rsquo;t entirely fair to say, since it&rsquo;s actually 10am where I live.
Thursday we (me and my Dad) arrived and met up at the airport around 3:30. Checked in and walked to the Riviera. We registered and picked up our badges, but by that point there weren&rsquo;t any more talks and the vendor area was still being set up, so we just left and took a cab to the MGM Grand.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/infamous/">
            <p class="note title">inFamous</p><p class="note date">2009-07-27</p><p class="note content">The last couple of Saturdays I spent the evening working on inFamous at a buddy&rsquo;s place, and this past one I finished it. You&rsquo;ve got a big GTA style city to run around in and electricity-based superpowers. The game hypes up &ldquo;choice&rdquo; your character has to make. What would you do in a city with superpowers?
Sound is fine, there are some good music tracks but most of it is forgettable.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/ion_09/">
            <p class="note title">ION '09</p><p class="note date">2009-07-26</p><p class="note content">Attended the Invasion of Normandy event at skirmish last weekend. Definitely an event I&rsquo;ll remember for some time.
Friday
To get warmed up we started with a free game that went from 6-9pm. Imagine two large forts on opposite ends of a course that is shaped like a large U (but rather than being a 180 degree U it was more like 120). Between the forts are small dinky towns and a lot of woods, and scattered about are big white jugs.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

            <p class="note title">Mobile Devices and Site Design</p><p class="note date">2011-03-10</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;ve noticed something about game-related websites lately: the trend of making the site more friendly to mobile device browsers at the expense of traditional computers. I don&rsquo;t begrudge device owners; I browse on my phone too when I really need to, but I don&rsquo;t own an iPad. It is not, nor will it be for a long time, a practical use of my time. I have no problem if you own one to play Angry Birds.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/minecraft/">
            <p class="note title">Minecraft</p><p class="note date">2011-02-26</p><p class="note content">I just got out of a mixology class where I&rsquo;ve been drinking mixed drinks for 3 hours.
Minecraft touches me in ways I had forgotten about. You punch/mine blocks of resources, then pick them up or craft them into new objects and place them in a game world. The emphasis is on exploration and creativity; you collect resources and use them to build whatever you want. The charming (crappy) graphics and &ldquo;physics&rdquo; actually make for a rather intuitive experience.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fudcon_2011/">
            <p class="note title">FUDCon 2011</p><p class="note date">2011-02-20</p><p class="note content">A few weeks ago I attended FUDCon, the Fedora Users and Developers Conference. This year it took place in Tempe, Arizona at the Arizona State University.
At Red Hat my primary job function is to be the Release Engineer for the company&rsquo;s Cloud and Virtualization products and efforts. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux images in Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 were built by me using tools I wrote internally. Much of the work I&rsquo;ve done has been made public and available to the Fedora community, but there is still a lot of work to do: the work to integrate my tools with Fedora&rsquo;s infrastructure and release process is still on going.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/droid_tethering/">
            <p class="note title">Droid Tethering</p><p class="note date">2011-01-23</p><p class="note content">This weekend Muffin and I moved to our new apartment. We just finished unpacking the bedroom accessories and living room. Unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t have an internet connection until Friday. This makes my evenings very boring.
Usually, this is the time to hijack a neighbor&rsquo;s unsecured wireless network, but when it comes to working from home or doing a little online banking, I&rsquo;m not really comfortable using someone else&rsquo;s connection. It could turn out they&rsquo;d be someone like me.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/droid_incredible_rooted/">
            <p class="note title">Droid Incredible Rooted</p><p class="note date">2011-01-18</p><p class="note content">While the Droid Incredible does a lot of cool things and lots of nifty apps exist for it, the one thing it can&rsquo;t do out of the box is remove pre-installed crap courtesy of the carrier. This included integration with Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Verizon&rsquo;s own implementations for map navigation and video/picture sharing suites. After 2 days of use, I couldn&rsquo;t take having the bloat anymore.
I followed this guide. For the most part it worked as described, however there are a few addendums I will point out here.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/metarpg_0%2e2_released/">
            <p class="note title">MetaRPG 0.2 Released</p><p class="note date">2010-12-31</p><p class="note content">MetaRPG 0.2.0 has been released; what the new version brings is listed here.
You can also see what I have planned for 0.3.0.</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/brute_forcing_ai/">
            <p class="note title">Brute Forcing AI</p><p class="note date">2010-12-30</p><p class="note content">Similar to cracking passwords, computers can brute-force solve single-player puzzles too, as long as the following criteria is met:
 The puzzle has a well defined start state. There are 1 or more states where the game is said to be won. There is a finite number of moves a player can make.  During the flights to and from St. Louis to visit Muffin&rsquo;s family, I occupied my time putting this hypothesis to the test with Sudoku.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/the_bookstore/">
            <p class="note title">The Bookstore</p><p class="note date">2010-12-26</p><p class="note content">Days before Thanksgiving I visited Lute and his girlfriend at their place in PA. One evening we picked up drinks at a place called The Bookstore. At the time they were having a Thanksgiving-eve special with a unique menu and discounts. The place is a 20&rsquo;s themed speakeasy, and they take the theme seriously:
 Except for 4 or so electric lamps, the entire place is lit by candles and kerosene lamps.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/fedora_14/">
            <p class="note title">Fedora 14</p><p class="note date">2010-11-02</p><p class="note content">ust a quick note that Fedora 14 has been released. The main website has gotten a new look as well that should be more useful to beginners. The feature list is targeted mostly at developers and virt-admins this time around, less about the desktop itself</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/hardware_hell/">
            <p class="note title">Hardware Hell</p><p class="note date">2010-10-31</p><p class="note content">My dubiously functioning hardware gave me a scare this afternoon as I tried to install 4 more gigabytes of RAM.
Presently it only has 2G, so I figured it was time for an upgrade to 6G before installing Win 7. Once I installed the pair of 2G sticks however, all was not well. Powering the computer on would lead to one of two results, I could not discern a pattern: never display anything or beep, or print out the the following to the console:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">

    <h1 class="article title">Wolfenstein</h1><p class="article date">2009-08-30</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>I just finished the new Wolfenstein that was released 2 weeks ago. This will be a favorable review, so lets start with the bad stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grunt nazis can be a little brain-dead at times. On more than one occasion I&rsquo;d be fighting a squad of them, and one-by-one they&rsquo;d suddenly come barreling around the corner into my gunfire. They can also be a little predictable with the cover and gun-emplacements they&rsquo;ll choose to use. They don&rsquo;t really support each other either.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m probably alone in this, but the &ldquo;elite guards&rdquo; are all identical-looking women with their tits nearly falling out of their tight uniforms. Immersion was destroyed every time I fought one. I hate fan service.</li>
<li>The overall difficulty of the game left something to be desired. Except for the last level, I died about 3 times, and that was playing on Hard. There is an Uber skill level, I may try that and see if that gives me an adequate challenge.</li>
<li>While the weapons in the game are very imaginative and fun to shoot, gameplay-wise many of them are identical. The flamethrower, Tesla Cannon, Particle Cannon, and MP40 are all short range spray-n&rsquo;-pray weapons. The LF44 and Panzer-whatever are both rocket launchers. All that remains is a sniper rifle and assault rifle.</li>
<li>This game has some serious hand-holding built into it when going from objective to objective. It&rsquo;s not intrusive, but with the in-game compass it&rsquo;s literally impossible to get lost because it gives you a way-point by way-point path to your destination. ADD xbox360 users rejoice.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that all out, this still is a solid game. The story, while extreme in the sci-fi sense (but not crappy-syfy-channel-movie sense), is still entertaining and motivating. Graphically the game is very pretty, but so are all modern games. I do have to call out the sound and music in this game: very well done. Grenades and gunfire up close are loud and snappy, and at a distance are heavy thudding reports. Breaking windows and objects sound awesome on a good system or set of headphones.</p>
<p>There are thousands of nazi grunts and SS that need to be shot, and while there are tons of WW2 shooters out there, few of them have an occultist fling that leads to out-right magic. Tougher enemies are imaginative and interesting, but sadly they are few and far between until the last few levels. Bosses are well done and challenging: they often demand a strategy or employ Metroid-style gameplay elements.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, it does little that is particularly original, but it executes well and is enjoyable. WW2 shooters are overdone, but this one really doesn&rsquo;t fit in that category since you&rsquo;re battling monsters from alternate realities and casting spells. Worth $50 if you really like shooters, worth it to everyone else once the price comes down.</p>

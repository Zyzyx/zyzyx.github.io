    <h1 class="article title">DefCon (Part 3)</h1><p class="article date">2009-08-03</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>DefCon is over, which is a sad thing since some shenanigans were just getting interesting. A couple of tweets like this one started rumors of a trojan on the DefCon CD, which turned out to be false. A few people were arrested on the roof of the Riviera; they got there after learning how to pick locks. And someone installed a fake ATM machine in the hotel.</p>
<p>Saturday night with Plake turned out to be a lot of fun. Sunday I attended the following talks:</p>
<pre><code>(***  ) Advanced SQL Injection: Somewhat thought provoking. Presentation was hurt by the fact the presenter was hung over, and didn't charge his laptop battery. You may think that makes it awesome, but try to do it after knowing there are better talks happening that you're missing.
(**** ) Lockpicking Forensics: Initially I didn't think there would be much to this, but it turns out you can pretty easily tell (if you have a big microscope) if a lock as been picked, bumped, or forced. To some degree you can tell the skill of the intruder as well.
(*    ) USB Attacks: This one was misnamed. Even with the abstract this one sounded more high level talk, when really it should have been &quot;we accidentally found an exploit in linux USB drivers&quot;. The speaker refused to point out where in the code the flaw was due to &quot;politics&quot;. You fail sir.
(**   ) Social Zombies: This was little more than an overview of why social networks are insecure and easy to subvert. It was interesting but most of the content was known to me. A twitter-botnet was kind of cool to watch though.
</code></pre>
<p>Like I mentioned in an earlier post, I didn&rsquo;t have high expectations for the talks today, which is why I spent 2 hours at the Lockpicking Village instead. I learned a ton there, and it really is a hobby that demands some finesse and skill. They even had practice locks, which would have only 1 or 2 pins in them, rather than the 4 or 5 in a typical house lock. I did open a few of those, but I wasn&rsquo;t cool enough to graduate to real locks used today. I also learned how to open combination locks (like the ones on HS lockers) with a beer can and a pair of scissors. McGuyver&rsquo;d!</p>
<p>Sunday night we ate at the Rio and saw Penn and Teller&rsquo;s show, which was of course awesome. They&rsquo;ve really got their act down. Collected autographs from each of them as well.</p>

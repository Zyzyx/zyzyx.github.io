    <h1 class="article title">Droid Tethering</h1><p class="article date">2011-01-23</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>This weekend Muffin and I moved to our new apartment. We just finished unpacking the bedroom accessories and living room. Unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t have an internet connection until Friday. This makes my evenings very boring.</p>
<p>Usually, this is the time to hijack a neighbor&rsquo;s unsecured wireless network, but when it comes to working from home or doing a little online banking, I&rsquo;m not really comfortable using someone else&rsquo;s connection. It could turn out they&rsquo;d be someone like me.</p>
<p>Last night I investigated and tried tethering my smart phone. Tethering basically means turning your smart phone into a wireless router. Clients (like the laptop I&rsquo;m typing this on) connect to it like any other wireless network, but the internet content is coming in from the 2/3/4G network. Now whenever I have my phone on me, I have an internet connection. I&rsquo;m tempted to call and tell Comcast to shove off, but I can&rsquo;t leave my phone at home at all times for when Muffin needs the internet, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So far it is not against the terms of service to tether, but that could change in the future. Users are discouraged to over-utilize the cell network; it&rsquo;s not a good idea to download 40 gigs content from your phone. The network really isn&rsquo;t meant for that, and it also sends up red flags to the carrier. I would guess the more red flags they see, the sooner they&rsquo;ll crack down.</p>
<p>Tethering your phone has been made quite easy after step one: rooting it. It also requires a netfilter-enabled kernel. Droid Incredibles (which are android 2.2 based) have that already, but if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll need to install a custom one. Once that is done, you just have to download the Tethering app from the marketplace.</p>

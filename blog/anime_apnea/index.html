    <h1 class="article title">Anime Apnea</h1><p class="article date">2013-07-22</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>The wife has the Netflix account and does way more viewing than I do. Recently a few anime series were recommended that we watched together. The first was <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6634"target="_blank">Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit</a>, and then came <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Black Butler<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I won&rsquo;t got into summaries here, you can use the links for that. Instead I&rsquo;ll briefly explain what I liked and disliked.</p>
<p>Moribito is the type of anime I like, the target audience is meant to be mature and it spends a fair amount of time exploring the world they created. I liked how they tied history, setting, and religion together in this one. It does have 3 or 4 episodes of filler in the first season, so be ready for that. The was a plot hole or two as well that we found confusing. There&rsquo;s one part in particular where a character falls down a steep slope (almost a cliff) and the pursuers are like &ldquo;well, we can&rsquo;t go down there&rdquo; and just turn around and leave.</p>
<p>Black Butler I had a hard time staying with. It has a lot of the Sailor Moon style mannerisms with 2 frames of animation, a lot of high pitched female yapping, and large emotional icons like blue drips and red throbbing veins. They really club you over the head with some of the character&rsquo;s devotions too, which is exacerbated when you watch the episodes back to back. It was entertaining though.</p>

I&rsquo;m advocating an Open Source project, so that is close enough to work for now. There&rsquo;s more benefit to the company than these meetings at least.</p>
<p>Last weekend I flashed my router, an <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RTN16/"target="_blank">ASUS NT-16</a>, with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenWRT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previously flashed with TomatoUSB<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I found out a few months ago that development had pretty much ended. I&rsquo;m not sure where interest went, but I saw that OpenWRT gets a lot of sponsorship from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EFF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I figured it was a good bet. I really wanted to get off of Tomato after the rash of security flaws with trendy names, and OpenWRT was just finishing up their latest release.</p>
<p>OpenWRT also has a release naming scheme that I am a big fan of. Like Ubuntu, they go with alphabetical alliterations, but instead of adjective-animal, they use cocktail names. The current release is Barrier Breaker, so once I finished flashing, I had a cocktail suggestion to celebrate the occasion, which I did on Saturday at 10:30am.</p>
<p>Flashing was pretty easy this time around, only 3 easy steps: download the image, write it to the &ldquo;linux&rdquo; MTD, and then reboot. I had to do a little <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data mining<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to figure out what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->subarchitecture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my router was. The MTD command was:</p>

<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->installation and configuration documentation for OpenWRT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is very good. I was impressed with the breadth of information. I still have a step to go, the image I used comes with the open source b43 broadcom driver, which does not support wireless-N nor multiple SSIDs. Since I&rsquo;d like to have both of those things, I need to use either the brcmsmac module, or Broadcom&rsquo;s closed-source drivers. I expect to hack that together this coming weekend. So far the router has been working fine, a few devices around the house needed a reset to figure out that the wireless encryption algorithm had changed, but otherwise the transition has been pretty smooth.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">How to Get Extreme</h1><p class="article date">2013-03-15</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>With the new Pope getting chosen religion has been a popular topic around the folks I hang out with. Surrounded by engineers and software types it goes without saying that the majority of them are self proclaimed atheists or agnostics. Not all, but most. A small percentage of them though, I&rsquo;d describe as hostile to religious types in general. Any mention of the term will bring up a diatribe about the crusades, genocides, and whatever else can be laid at the feet of those fighting for &hellip; well whatever they thought was worth killing for.</p>
<p>A few days ago though, I was playing Guild Wars 2 and running a dungeon with a group of strangers. A pick-up group or PUG in MMO parlance. I was the 5th member in a group of 5 that joined, and a conversation was already in progress:</p>
<pre><code>[MemberA] ok to tolerate them but i just say nothing
[MemberB] follow jesus or gtfo
[MemberC] yeah sometimes you have to give them a little push to get on board
[MemberB] with a stick :-P
[MemberA] lol
[MemberC] well a push to join or push to get away either works
[Zyzyx] I honestly can't tell the difference between you guys and a Fundamentalist Islamic sleeper cell right now.
You have been kicked from the group.
</code></pre><p>So now I&rsquo;ve seen both sides within the span of a week. You know these types of people exist because the world is a big place with a lot of humans in it. My thought is that people get that way when they&rsquo;ve surrounded themselves with like-minded friends. They&rsquo;ve insulated themselves from dissenting opinions or arguments, so they&rsquo;re comfortable with expressing sensationalized ideas. When this behavior becomes the norm and is generally accepted within the group&hellip; the participants exaggerate and sensationalize even further, and this snowballs to a point where words are no longer enough to be the outspoken tough guy.</p>
<p>This laeds to taking real action, or planning to. Now they&rsquo;re extremists. My recommendation: get out more. It&rsquo;s healthy to get some criticism now and again to keep the extremism down. Seriously. Many religious authority figures do this already for exactly that reason: to understand other view points. I encourage you to do the same.</p>

It was time to upgrade. They were by Samsung, model SCH-I545, Android version 4.3 and a baseband version of VRUEMK2. Those bits of data are important for people who want to root the device using <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2565758"target="_blank">these instructions</a>. The XDA forums are the place to go for this sort of information; they were shockingly easy this time around. Far easier than the Incredible.</p>
<p>Once the phone was rooted, I installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NoBloat<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an app that removes system apps. Finally I can get rid of the pre-installed Samsung and Verizon shit I don&rsquo;t want. What pushed me over the edge this time was when I decided to update a few apps, I had more than 20 pending, and I didn&rsquo;t recognize a third of them. Using a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spreadsheet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was able to safely remove them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of reclaiming space on the device, or always seeing apps I don&rsquo;t care about in the listings, although that is annoying. The primary driver is I do not trust these organizations to maintain good software for the duration I will use the phone. Ars Technica <!-- raw HTML omitted -->makes a good argument<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about this too. Cell phone makers and cell phone carriers are not software companies.</p>
<p>I only want to use their content to the extent I have to, and I&rsquo;m glad to be rid of most of it now.</p>

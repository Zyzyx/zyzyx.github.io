    <h1 class="article title">Headphone Repair</h1><p class="article date">2011-12-11</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>I own a set of Bose headphones that I&rsquo;ve had for about 3 to 4 years. At the time of purchase it was $160, and the current model available today is the AE2 They get my recommendation.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been giving them a hard life. I frequently brought them back and forth from home to work so I could listen to music, and the strain had finally worn through one of the wires near the connection in the left headphone. Sadly, it was to the point that electrical contact was no longer happening, the speak produced no sound. I really didn&rsquo;t want to spend another $140 on headphones, so I set out to repair them myself. I figured it had to be a fairly straightforward task, and the worst that could happen was I&rsquo;d fail to repair them.</p>
<p>I began by shaving off the rubber sleave at the site of wear on the wire. You have to be really careful you don&rsquo;t cut through the wires themselves, of course. I imagine if I had proper wire cutters this would have been a little easier. I discovered that the wire had a pair of copper wires within it: one green one the usual copper hue. Green typically indicates left channel in the audio world and I guessed the copper twist was the ground. I twisted the corresponding wires together to reconnect them.</p>
<p>Figuring that wasn&rsquo;t enough to ensure constant contact, I hit them with a little solder. It smoked and smelled, but eventually I got a reasonable result.</p>
<p>I plugged them in and to my surprise they worked again. I don&rsquo;t expect it to be perfect but hey, I&rsquo;ll get a little more life out of them at least. So far I don&rsquo;t hear any fuzz or noise, they still sound pretty good. Even if it only lasts another week I&rsquo;ll still call it a victory. With the addition of a little electrical tape it should hold for a little while at least. Only took me about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I really need to get more into small electronics.</p>

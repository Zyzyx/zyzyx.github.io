    <h1 class="article title">Amon Tobin</h1><p class="article date">2013-06-02</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Friday night I was at the <a href="http://crossroadspresents.com/paradise-rock-club/"target="_blank">Paradise Rock Club in Boston</a> to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amon Tobin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The show was not at all what I expected, but I probably had the wrong expectation. We arrived when the doors opened to the venue at 8pm, but to our surprise, there was only about 20 people there. It definitely was the right time and place. The venue is small: barely more than a night club with a stage. And that&rsquo;s what the show turned out to be: a night club performance.</p>
<p>It was unusual to hear samples I recognized, and rare to hear more than 30 seconds of music I recognized from this albums, of which I have the middle 3. Instead it was a lot of trance, acid, and dubstep. He was absolutely a professional mixer: everything flowed well. It was certainly enjoyable (and loud) just not what I expected. He began performing at 10:30 and by then the venue was full.</p>
<p>The crowd was a cross section of Friday-night-club-goers, Ravers, and white guys like me that knew the artist from his albums (probably). I have to give a special shout-out to &ldquo;Wolfboy&rdquo;, the 20-something with tickle-me-elmo pajamas and a brownish pikachu hat. Thank you for reminding me when I grew up.</p>
<p>During the show the table his gear was on was creating problems, which in the end made the rest of the night a lot more fun. The set up was a crappy fold-up plastic table from target that was sitting on sideways toilet paper rolls, which in turn were sitting on the sides of cinder-blocks. This ghetto set-up is usually meant to prevent turntable needles from skipping from bass vibrations, but Mr. Tobin did not have any turntables, nor was the table staying in place. Early in the show, one leg of the table slid off the prop and almost took out all of his equipment&hellip; that might have been expensive. For the next half hour or so, he was visibly worried, he frequently checked the table leg and was careful about how he touched the electronic panels.</p>
<p>Later, the leg slipped again, and this time the whole table feel off the mounts and on the floor. It was still upright and nothing fell off, but it was 2&rsquo; lower or so, and now he had to hunch to mix his work. He expressed a little frustration, but was clearly relieved; he began drinking and smoking once he started performing again. He rocked out, danced, and began working the crowd. It was much more relaxed and I think he expressed that in the music he was producing. His back might have hurt by the end though.</p>
<p>It was a good time, I didn&rsquo;t get home until 2am. But the pro-tip is that if you go see a Drum and Bass artist at a night club, expect to get a night club performance, and a night club experience.</p>

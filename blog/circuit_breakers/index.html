    <h1 class="article title">Circuit Breakers</h1><p class="article date">2012-02-22</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>The first major home improvement I&rsquo;ve been up to lately is mounting the TV in the living room above the fireplace. That project is complete and I&rsquo;ll cover that in a future post, but one side quest that came up was adding another circuit to the circuit breaker so we could power it and add an outlet to the living room. This was enough of a side project that I felt it needed a separate post.</p>
<p>My dad assisted with this, which made for a good father-son project. He&rsquo;s the Principal Director for Process Control Systems at <a href="http://www.lilly.com/about/Pages/about.aspx"target="_blank">Eli-Lilly</a> (formerly ImClone Systems, Inc.), responsible for all of the electrical systems at a large pharmaceutical manufacturing plant. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing. The purpose of this post is to serve as a reference in the future, if I ever need to expand electrical circuits in my house again, which I will when I finish the basement.</p>
<ul>
<li>White wires are neutral (return to the circuit breaker), bare or green wires are grounds. Black and red wires are hot, they carry current from the main. Typically you only see red for three-phase switches.</li>
<li>That one white line that comes from a breaker is actually a hot wire. This indicates whomever wired that portion of the house is a moron.</li>
<li>When shutting everything down, begin at the bottom of the breakers and work your way up. Do not start with the master. Make sure sensitive electronics are off and protected.</li>
<li>Even when the master breaker is off, the trunk lines are still live. If you put your finger in those breakers, you&rsquo;ll take a 120 or 240 volt shock, which is good for your heart.</li>
<li>In the back of the breaker box is a metal plate that carries the current that zig-zags around several prongs. The breakers snap onto those prongs, which is how they draw from the main.</li>
<li>In my house, for whatever reason, the top two prongs do not exist, so no breakers can be used there.</li>
<li>To add another circuit to the existing box, my only choice is replace a single 15-amp breaker with a double. There are only so many of those left.</li>
<li>My system is a 100-amp draw, which is comparatively low, and may require an increase when finishing the basement and adding another circuit. I can use an amp-meter to check load on the trunk to see how close I am to the maximum draw. If I exceed that, the master breakers will trip.</li>
<li>Another option is to add an additional breaker box, and/or increase the amperage of the existing system. The latter option is likely very expensive, and will involve paying an electrician to replace the trunk lines, because they&rsquo;re rated at 100-amp. If I increased it to 200, they would like catch on fire and melt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing with your house&rsquo;s power supply is fun. Highly recommended if you enjoy standing around in the dark with a flashlight trying to figure out why a breaker you bought does not work!</p>

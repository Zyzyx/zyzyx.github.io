    <h1 class="article title">Bioshock: Infinite</h1><p class="article date">2010-09-22</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Mogg recently brought my attention to Bioshock Infinite, a game I have a skeptical view of. Before continuing with this post, I highly recommend you read an interview with Ken Levine and one with Timothy Gerritson. There is a game-play video as well. Well, sort of a game-play video. Ok, not really, but it is still cool to watch.</p>
<p>After reading Levine&rsquo;s interview, I had renewed interested in the franchise. The most interesting thing in Bioshock for me was not the plot, not the gameplay, but the setting. I liked discovering how Rapture fell, how society was coming apart when human ingenuity and discovery ran too far. I played through the first 2 levels of Bioshock 2 and lost interest. It felt like more of the same and didn&rsquo;t hold me. Everything that needed to be explored in the setting had already been explored, there wasn&rsquo;t anything more to add to it. This is echoed in Gerritson&rsquo;s statements. Also multiplayer? Seriously?</p>
<p>According to him though, Bioshock Infinite is a completely separate and distinct world from Bioshock (One). It sounds like this game will share similar themes to the original game: this grand city in the sky is falling apart too, and you the player will discover why. This is part of the lure for me, and I definitely am interested in a new setting as deep as Bioshocks. The art direction and time period is much the same as the original as well.</p>
<p>Then I read Gerritson&rsquo;s interview, and my marketing bullshit detector started going off. While the first Bioshock was great, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the hype surrounding it and emphasis on player choice. Your actions have consequences! What will you do!? Oooh, I&rsquo;m in control here. Actually no, you just have to decide whether you kill little girls for resources, and that decision controls what ending you see. Obviously I killed them frequently. The player-choice hype was a load, it was an excuse to get you to play the game a second time, just like Infamous.</p>
<p>Gerritson contradicts himself multiple times, and that makes him a taffer. Maybe he&rsquo;s just bad at articulating what Levine tried to get across: Bioshock is not about a underwater world that fell apart, it&rsquo;s about worlds that have fallen apart because of some unrestrained aspect of human creativity. I like this concept. I&rsquo;d be interested in more steam-punk worlds beyond a sky city or sunken slum that fall apart for some reason. However I&rsquo;m also keenly aware of how Irrational&rsquo;s discussion with 2K about a new game may have really went:</p>
<pre><code>2K: What do you guys want to do next?
Irrational: We want to create an entirely new FPS game!
2K: Fine, but slap Bioshock's title on it so it will sell and draw attention.
Irrational: OK!
</code></pre><p>For now, I&rsquo;m cautiously interested. What about you?</p>

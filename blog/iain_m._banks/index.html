    <h1 class="article title">Iain M. Banks</h1><p class="article date">2011-04-01</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Lately I have been reading books by this author; the setting he is most known for is the Culture. It is as Sci-Fi as it gets. In this post I will be intentionally be vague so I don&rsquo;t give too much away. It is important to understand that you don&rsquo;t learn everything you need to know about the Culture in the first book, you learn a little more with each one. It all takes place in the 70s relative to Earth time; humans are actually not a part of the Culture (although how the Culture reacted to discovering us was explored).</p>
<p>First some facts to help set the scope we&rsquo;re talking about here. The Culture is an amalgamation of species that at some point, decided to take their evolution and society into their own hands. They&rsquo;ve been a space-faring entity for many thousands of years, and the census is some 30 trillion. Their technological progress far exceeds our own; we&rsquo;re talking Star Trek levels here. It is a post-scarcity setting, one where any resource is available that you want, so money is unnecessary because everyone can get what they desire.</p>
<p>Sentient AI has been invented as well, thousands of years ago, and indeed the machines are responsible for managing the production, maintenance and support of the Culture. The most powerful constructs are Minds: enormously powerful computers that handle tasks for entire systems of planets, ships, and other habitats. They are the pinnacle of Culture technology; they dwarf other accomplishments like city-sized space ships, manufactured planets, or growing new bodies for beings that have been be-headed.</p>
<p>The books explore this setting by asking questions like how different species react to machine sentience, how they reconcile their religions when faced with this sort of utopia, and how the Culture integrates newly discovered sentient life into their society. The latter is where a lot of the conflict in the books come from. The author also explores how Culture beings would live and perceive themselves. They live up to 300 years, frequently entering relationships with other species (or genders), changing genders themselves and pursuing all sorts of hobbies and interests.</p>
<p>You can read more about the setting on Wikipedia. I&rsquo;m 4 books in and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed them quite a bit so far. He also wrote The Algebraist, which I&rsquo;m told by co-workers is a must-read.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Honeymoon: Tortuguero</h1><p class="article date">2010-08-18</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>We began our eco-touring in one of the wettest parts of the country: Tortuguero. We knew we were getting remote when we had to take a river boat up a river for an hour and half to reach the lodge. It is not possible to reach it on foot (for the average person), let alone a car. First we all climbed into a bus and headed to the Rio Dante: a small open-air restaurant on the outskirts of the reserve.</p>
<p>After breakfast there (it was 8am, Costa Rican time, which is 2 hours behind Eastern) we travelled to the river port. It was about a 2 hour ride. The roads were in horrible condition; the guide called it a Costa Rican Massage because they were so bumpy. While crossing one of the bridge there were 2 holes clear through it, and they stuck road blocks around them so folks wouldn&rsquo;t drive over them.</p>
<p>We passed through a banana plantation and 20 miles of farmland. I took a few guerilla pictures to capture the conditions farmers live in&hellip; I felt like I should pay more for bananas after seeing some of these homes.</p>
<p>Finally we made it to the lodging, called Mawamba. The reserve is required by law to have as small a footprint as possible, so you really felt like roughing it while still being able to feel civil.</p>
<p>While staying at the lodge we took several tours: visited a small butterfly garden, explored wildlife from a river boat, and checked out Tortuguero village. The village we only had Liz&rsquo;s camera, I&rsquo;ll post those pictures if I ever get to it. For now though, here is a small sampling of the wildlife we found on those tours. I&rsquo;ll start with plants and flowers, then move onto the animal life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Tortuguero. I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how wet that place is (being rain forest). It didn&rsquo;t rain much, but the whole time it was like we were living in a hot cloud. Nothing dries because the humidity is so high. I walked into the lodge one night after being in the pool and tracked in water. After sleeping for the night, the next morning I saw my tracks were still on the floor. You sweat constantly, and our dirty clothes were disgusting, but it was an experience to remember. I don&rsquo;t think visit a rain-forest again in a near future, but maybe it&rsquo;ll appeal again in a couple years.</p>

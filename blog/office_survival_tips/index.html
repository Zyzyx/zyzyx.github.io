    <h1 class="article title">Office Survival Tips</h1><p class="article date">2013-04-11</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>The last couple months I&rsquo;ve been making a habit of going to the mini-gym in the office for 45 minutes or so before starting the work day. This is part of a broader effort to not be a just another flabby white software engineer. As a courtesy to my co-workers, I shower afterward and bring a change of clothes. Recently however, my perfect man-plan had a disastrous oversight.</p>
<p>Working out went without a problem, the mirrors around the room stood and acknowledged my efforts and proclaimed the results to others. The shower was cool and freshing. I lavished my flesh with Axe Bodyspray with the recommended cross-like gesture in the commercials. It was time to change into work appropriate clothes, because I am a business pro, and I go like one. Except when I bring my wife&rsquo;s pants instead of mine. Wait what?</p>
<p>How did that happen? The jeans don&rsquo;t look that similar, I certainly didn&rsquo;t go to the wrong dresser in the morning. One of us must have put it in my drawer. Which of us was the last to do laundry?</p>
<p>&hellip;
&hellip;
&hellip; shit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter now, I have to get through today. I&rsquo;m not going to drive back home because I already spent so much time today looking fabulous. I got up at 7:00 so that I could start my day on time, I&rsquo;m not going to head back and return late and then have to make up an excuse. I brought the wrong pants, so I&rsquo;m going to wear them. There is no other recourse; I wear the pants here!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most important thing is to act natural.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Thankfully, the pants fit reasonably well, and I brought a belt, but of course the cut is all wrong. This is an office full of male software engineers, they barely know how to dress themselves already. I mean look at them. Jesus. Nobody will notice. I just have to act natural and not look vulnerable or guilty. If any were suspicious that I was wearing women&rsquo;s pants, looking conscientious of it would confirm it.</p>
<p>I just have to look really busy at my desk, and never leave it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take meetings on the phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead of getting up to go to a room. This should be easy. I should <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eat lunch at the desk too<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The hours go by, no problems yet. It&rsquo;ll be just another day at the office.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1pm. I shouldn&rsquo;t have drank so much tea. I have to use the restroom, but no problem. Walk confidently and briskly. Things to do. Business pro. Make it to the urinal and !??! wtf? This zipper is tiny! Maybe I can&hellip; no. Not enough room. Ok, nobody else is here, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pee in a stall<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Business pro. Sit down because standing up to pee in a stall is what girls do. I mean guys that are insecure, not girls. Whatever we&rsquo;re almost through this.</p>
<p>Back to the desk. Ok, back to work. The last few hours will go by quick, no more meetings, I can just throw on the headphones and get through the rest of the day. Nobody seems to have noticed and most of the day is over.</p>
<p>Crap! A female coworker! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Women know how to dress and will certainly notice their own pants so they must be avoided<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. She&rsquo;s coming here. At my desk. No choice, the headphones have to come off and conversation will begin. Can&rsquo;t slide my chair out though. Look busy. Shitshitshit. Conversation is harmless, I&rsquo;m ok so far, I just can&rsquo;t get up, and must avoid talking about finding someone else to rope in. That would mean I&rsquo;d have to get up to find them. Recommend more emails. Suggest a meeting tomorrow when you have the right pants. She leaves, satisfied with the engagement.</p>
<p>Made it. End of the day. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wait a little later than usual to leave<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so that the odds of someone catching me are less. Parking lot, almost there. Car. Shit! Pick up the keys, get in. Ignition. I drive out of there, friendly waves and smiles if necessary but not stopping for anything. Home free.</p>
<p>Business pro.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Healthcare Today</h1><p class="article date">2009-12-16</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you have an opinion on the state of health care and how to reform it, but not one informed well enough that you&rsquo;re comfortable with being regularly vocal about it. If you&rsquo;re not like me, get a job. Anyway, to assist with getting an informed opinion you are willing to share with others, I&rsquo;ve enclosed a series of podcasts from npr.org that really helped me understand how things are today. They don&rsquo;t dwell long on what needs to change or the Right Way to reform it, instead they&rsquo;re mostly educational looks at how healthcare works today. It&rsquo;s a very confusing, complex, and broken system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in current events and how to make sense of health care today, I highly recommend these podcasts. Each of them are 15-20 minutes long, so it&rsquo;ll only take a couple hours to listen through.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Google Hacking</h1><p class="article date">2011-08-11</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Weeks ago I downloaded a Google+ app for my phone. While it is a convenient means to stay abreast of what folks are posting in my circles, there is one glaring &ldquo;feature&rdquo; I detest: if you enable location services (GPS, and Google/Verizon), the app will show you people near your location that also have G+ profiles. You can add nearby folks to your circles using this information.</p>
<p>I keep location services off because, as an Android phone, I have about 14 seconds of battery life, and enabling the GPS exacerbates the problem. On Saturday I was weak with a head cold, and for a moment I turned the services on so that my phone would realize it was no longer in California and set the weather/time accordingly. But I forgot to turn them off.</p>
<p>Saturday morning I noticed I have dozens of Google notifications; and sudden 10 more followers. I don&rsquo;t know these people at all.</p>
<p>Now, I get that I&rsquo;m at fault here. I knew the risk when I got the app. I know I can hide/block all of these folks on my G+ account. Their posts are off to the side and I can ignore them easily. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not comfortable with social networking. It irks me a little that if I make a public post, these folks can comment on it (I think). The whole affair just makes me feel&hellip; uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So the rest of this post is about making Google do your bidding, since I accidentally did theirs to a larger degree than I&rsquo;m comfortable with. In a Google search you have several search operators and modifiers as shown on this table. This is not a complete list either, just the most useful ones in my experience.</p>

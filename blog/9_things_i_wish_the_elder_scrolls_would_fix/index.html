    <h1 class="article title">9 Things I Wish the Elder Scrolls Would Fix</h1><p class="article date">2011-12-04</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>There are 5 Elder Scrolls games: Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion and most recently, Skyrim. While all decent games, there are some behaviors that just never seem to get get fixed: they afflict at least 3 of the 5 games. Here they are in no particular order.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Waterfalls do not sound like garden hoses draining from your rooftop.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It is painfully obvious sometimes that Bethesda&rsquo;s Audio guys have never been to a real waterfall. There are quite a few shallow rapids that don&rsquo;t sound right either.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forgotten tombs should not have fresh carrots and potatoes in burlap sacks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m not sure if this is just the result of a loot algorithm being poor or if developers just didn&rsquo;t think about it. Who stores produce in a barrel in a sunken cave anyway?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lousy use of shadows.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think this is just a symptom of making it accessible and streamlined or whatever. There is never any use of darkness in this game other than as a mechanic for sneaking. Everything, I mean everything, is lit adequately enough so that you can see around. All caves have glowing fungus. All crypts have lit braziers or torches. This renders use of light spells and night-vision almost non-existent. Why even have them?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The player physics continues to suck.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m not talking about the jittery ragdoll effects or items tumbling about unrealistically. I mean that I can still walk sideways up a mountainside if I want to. It is trivial to get where you&rsquo;re not supposed to go in the game world. I don&rsquo;t understand how this became acceptable.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your allies are dumb as hell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They step on pretty much every trap. They still get hung up on world geometry and spawn or blink around whenever you step over an obstruction or jump over a hole. If you happen to be exploring a dungeon that requires you to jump down a pit or chasm, cross your fingers. Also they love standing in the middle of the hallway.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact, all NPCs are dumb as hell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I stole the entire contents of a shop and sold them back to the proprietor. I&rsquo;ve stolen all of the vegetables in a farm in front of the field worker and sold them back. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27GuSSha0s#!"target="_blank">This guy</a> spends his day putting baskets on peoples&rsquo; heads. GAME OF THE YEAR.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You never get any recognition for you major accomplishments except from the quest-giver itself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If I&rsquo;m the Arch-Mage of the magic college, why do guard still mock me like an urchin in the streets? I understand this behavior if I&rsquo;m not wearing anything that indicates I&rsquo;m from the college, but when I&rsquo;m wearing the robes and amulet? Come on.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cities are sprawling metropolises of 15 people.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I think Assassins&rsquo; Creed was the only medieval-era game that pulled off a populous city effectively.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me disable the hand holding.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I don&rsquo;t need or want the quest markers. Give me some general direction at least, but don&rsquo;t tell me exactly where the book I need is in a dungeon.</p>

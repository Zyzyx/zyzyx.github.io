    <h1 class="article title">US Broadband</h1><p class="article date">2009-10-30</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Not long ago I came across and article that mentioned the National Broadband Network or NBN. This is a government effort in Australia to bring 100Mb/s to 90% of the country/continent&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m almost unilaterally in favor of any government measure that keeps technology rolling forward. The biggest criticism for this project is that the Aussie government is spending about $43 billion dollars on it. With 8 million residents, that&rsquo;s about $5,000 being spent per household. The counter is that the links aren&rsquo;t used for just internet traffic or are just for residents. Large business will use the lines for TV, phone, and other forms of data, and such an advanced infrastructure will be attractive to high tech firms too.</p>
<p>Recently our government started talking with them on how the project is going, and I find that very encouraging. Lately the US has been falling behind the technology curve, which I find very discouraging. In Nashua it costs me $62 for plain old cable thanks to Comcast&rsquo;s monopoly abuse. You can get 160Mb/s cable in Japan for $20 (that&rsquo;s at least 3 times faster than FiOS anywhere in the US), and in Finland it is a legal right to have broadband Internet access. Furthermore, new technologies that demand more powerful infrastructure are opening up in other countries before the US, such as YouTube launching their HD service in Britain. What are we doing here in the US to catch up? Our ISPs are redefining what broadband means so they can claim more people have it. Comcast is trying to keep it defined as 200kb/s so the bar stays as low as possible and they can charge people more for the service they already have.</p>
<p>Do you guys find this as frustrating as I do? Anyone want to move to Australia?</p>

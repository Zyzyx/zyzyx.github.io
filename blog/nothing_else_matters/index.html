    <h1 class="article title">Nothing Else Matters</h1><p class="article date">2009-12-05</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Not long ago Mogg mentioned listening to Apocalyptica, a band consisting of a classical string instruments (bass, cello) plus drums whose music is covers of metal classics and much of their own material. This group came up on Pandora a few times for me as well, and I really enjoyed them, so finally I started listening more seriously.</p>
<p>One of the first pieces I recognized was a cover of Nothing Else Matters by Metallica; one I think we&rsquo;re all familiar with. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for the memories that those melodies were going to bring back. Metallica was the band that got me into metal, and the self-titled album (aka the Black Album) was the first one I purchased with my own money. I remember constantly listening to it on bus rides to and from school, going back to it when moving stuff into Mom&rsquo;s house in 6th grade, rides from awful nights at Red Lobster, and lastly after graduating high school.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain why I like the song so much, or why I find it so moving. It&rsquo;s not the lyrics; indeed I can scarcely remember them even now while I listen to the cover. But the melody, especially the solo, has always been very powerful.</p>
<p>So tonight here&rsquo;s to how things were, how things have changed, and most importantly, how things will change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a review of Machinarium. This is, literally, a point-and-click adventure game written in Flash. P-n-C games were popular in the early nineties, you rarely see these at all any more with today&rsquo;s graphics but this one was surprisingly good. It&rsquo;s only $10 that you can download from their site easily (and legitimately).</p>
<p>All of the artwork is hand-drawn, and has an Invader-Zim feel to it in some ways. The puzzles, except for 1 in particular, (maybe it&rsquo;s just me) were intuitive and thoughtful, but not trivially solvable. There is no dialog at all; all communication comes in the form of charming cartoons in thought-bubbles from the robots&rsquo; heads. There are about 10-12 hours of game-play depending on how smart you are. There isn&rsquo;t much in the way of story, but it does resolve well enough at the end. The setting isn&rsquo;t really explained either, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be: it&rsquo;s an alternative robot-world. Just explore it.</p>
<p>I do have to call out the music in particular for being really great. You can find samples here.</p>
<p>For only $10, it&rsquo;s hard to argue. I enjoyed it all the way through.</p>

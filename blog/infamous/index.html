    <h1 class="article title">inFamous</h1><p class="article date">2009-07-27</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>The last couple of Saturdays I spent the evening working on inFamous at a buddy&rsquo;s place, and this past one I finished it. You&rsquo;ve got a big GTA style city to run around in and electricity-based superpowers. The game hypes up &ldquo;choice&rdquo; your character has to make. What would you do in a city with superpowers?</p>
<p>Sound is fine, there are some good music tracks but most of it is forgettable. Graphics are&hellip; well it&rsquo;s on the PS3 so they&rsquo;re what you&rsquo;d expect. Story is interesting and somewhat engaging, though some things are a little contrived. The ending though has a twist that I thought was a bit cheesy. Spoiler: it involves time-travel with no warning beforehand.</p>
<p>Gameplay is good, and not too repetitive unless you&rsquo;re really anal about side quests and finding all items. The difficulty of the missions does a pretty good job while ramping up. The enemies were pretty cool and inspired, I think. In fact I may go as one of them for Halloween this year if I can get invited to a damn Halloween party. As you play you get more and more powers until you become quite a powerhouse. Depending on the choices you make, you get different powers, and they reflect your character&rsquo;s mindset. If you&rsquo;re a douche you&rsquo;ll get powers that are really explosive with a lot of indiscriminate collateral damage. If you&rsquo;re a nice guy they&rsquo;ll be more precise and clean. But this leads me to my biggest gripe.</p>
<p>The game isn&rsquo;t about choice really, you only ever have at most 2 options: be Jane Goodall or be that guy that shot up Virgina Tech in 2007. The powers you get are not quest driven, you just get them for being more and more extreme on either end. Personally I think it&rsquo;s more about making you play the game a second time than it is about meaningful choice. Lame.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a decent game. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a PS3 for it, but I would go to someone&rsquo;s house and play it through with them.</p>

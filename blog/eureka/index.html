    <h1 class="article title">Eureka</h1><p class="article date">2013-12-30</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>A few months ago a friend and I started talking about Doom, the classic game from the early 90s. Later that week I was over his house, where he was playing the game on his laptop. I go through this phase as well, every 2 years or so revisiting the game and playing a bunch of patch wads (custom maps) from the <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?dir=levels/doom2/"target="_blank">idgames archives</a>.</p>
<p>In the later stages of the phase I grab a doom map editor and work on one. Imagine my surprise when I saw a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new release of an editor for linux<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as recent as August, 2013. Behold, Eureka!</p>
<p>Naturally, I had to package that up and put it in Fedora, and I finally got around to following up on that during my christmas break. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eureka was accepted in the distro a few weeks ago<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I&rsquo;m now working on building it in Koji.</p>
<p>If you dig around the Eureka homepage, there are two other doom editing tools available: Visplane Explorer and Oblige, which generates random maps of doom on the fly based on some user input. In time I may package those up too. I have a silly plan to create Doom In the Cloud, a web frontend where you check a few boxes and get a few wads (levels) in return, generated in the cloud. THE CLOUD.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Nehrim</h1><p class="article date">2010-09-21</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Last week I started playing Nehrim, a total conversion mod for Oblivion. It features new art, music, monsters, items, dungeons, terrain&hellip; pretty much everything. It is completely distinct from Oblivion; it shares the same engine and a few art assets, the similarities end there. So far I have dropped about 20 hours into it, with no end in sight. To understand what I like about Nehrim, I have to begin with what I didn&rsquo;t like about Oblivion: character progression was unrewarding and repetitive. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the leveling system in Oblivion, I will revisit for the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p>Oblivion, like all of The Elder Scroll games, has a paramount design goal: freedom to explore and do whatever you want. After completing the initial (tutorial) dungeon, the player is let upon a fully accessible world, granting them the freedom to explore it at their leisure. They are free to work the main quest line as they please, or even forsake it entirely.</p>
<p>Because players can go anywhere, the designs came up with a methodology to scale monster difficulty and treasure value with the player&rsquo;s level. This sounds like a good idea on paper, but for several subjective reasons, I didn&rsquo;t like it:</p>
<ul>
<li>You never feel a sense of accomplishment when leveling. Monsters were always a challenge; you never get an opportunity to smash low level creatures that harassed you earlier in the game.</li>
<li>Dungeons very rarely had novel bosses or loot. It was all scaled with your level.</li>
<li>At higher levels, the enemy equipment and rank became nonsensical, and it broke the immersion. At level 20, literally every goblin in the game was a &ldquo;goblin warlord&rdquo;, and every bandit wore Daedric armor, alleged to be the most rare and powerful armor in the world.</li>
<li>You could screw yourself if you leveled up the wrong stat too quickly. If you brew a ton of potions and greatly increase a major non-combat skill like alchemy, suddenly you&rsquo;re 3 levels higher than you were before and all monsters scale appropriately. Your combat abilities are now disadvantageous.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found Oblivion to be very repetitive as well. The world is respectably large, but it was also procedurally generated, which means they wrote code to create the world for them. They ran erosion simulations on the mountains and forests to get a more realistic terrain. Again, cool ideas that sound great on paper, but I had a problem with them too. While it is neat to boast you have 8 square miles of forest in your game, I really don&rsquo;t want to walk about in that. It&rsquo;s boring. It&rsquo;s fun for the first 2 hours, but eventually it gets repetitive. Thankfully they have fast travel so you can teleport from place to place at your leisure. (of course this breaks any uncertainty players have with the environment. If you run out of resources, just fast-travel back to town.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible to have large worlds and not be repetitive. Stalker has done this multiple times: while I&rsquo;m exploring huge worlds I may run into a variety of encounters or environments. There are over 100 different dungeons in Oblivion, but they all fall into 5 categories/themes: Ayelid Ruins, Caves, Mines (which don&rsquo;t even look like mines), Stone Ruins, or Oblivion&rsquo;s version of Hell. Boring and repetitive. After the 4th quest to close an Oblivion gate and do yet another Hell dungeon I stopped caring.</p>
<p>With that all out of the way I can explain why Nehrim is so enjoyable: they scrapped the level-scaling system and manually constructed the world by hand. This came at the cost of making the world fully accessible from level 1. It very much is not, but it is far from linear. They world is divided up into different regions, and each region has a level range associated with it. The regions are very large (the total world size is bigger than Oblivion&rsquo;s), so if you wander into a swamp and start getting your ass kicked, you can check the map to see if you belong here. You can of course try anyway, and if you succeed, you&rsquo;ll accrue lots of XP.</p>
<p>Yes, XP in an Oblivion mod. You level by gaining experience points, not by using your skills (although they do go up very slowly if you do; it is much slower than in Oblivion). When you gain a level, you get Learning Points (LP) which you can spend along with gold at a trainer to increase your skills. If you&rsquo;ve played anything in the Gothic series, this system will be familiar to you.</p>
<p>Nothing is novel in Nehrim&rsquo;s leveling system, but it does fix exactly what I found wrong with Oblivion. The main quest line acts as a bread-crumb quest to lead you through the world. When you first start, after the tutorial dungeon and being held up at a mining site for a bit, your main-quest destination is through a region that is for level 7-14, and they give you no hints about where to continue leveling. You just have to wander around; you&rsquo;ll find small towns and dungeons all over the place to explore.</p>
<p>The dungeons are much better designed. While they do reuse many art assets, a lot of the new stuff does a good job of hiding the recurring dungeon themes from Oblivion, or grants them the freedom to hybridize themes: a cave becomes a mine that becomes an underwater crypt. All dungeons have interesting loot somewhere in them, and frequently a special named enemy. They&rsquo;re usually not unique monster models, but a named one with fancy loot is a lot better than another gang of 20 vampires all wearing the same equipment.</p>
<p>The mod isn&rsquo;t perfect though. I could be getting the Illinoise award, but my game crashes frequently in the capital city, it lasts about 20 minutes at a time, sometimes more. Nehrim does make a few graphical improvements to keep the game engine from looking dated, but in a few places my computer really chugs for a few seconds while loading the next region, and I don&rsquo;t remember it doing that in Oblivion.</p>
<p>Oh, the game is in German. There is a translated English version too, but you only get subtitles. Personally I like games in foreign languages, it helps make the world feel more distant and unique. The translations are very good; there are the occasional oddities in grammar or misspellings but they are rare (seen about 5 total). In the capital city there is a building called the &ldquo;Money and Greed Bank&rdquo; which I thought was funny.</p>
<p>The main quest is a little awkward to follow along initially. The first few steps result in your character making decisions I personally wouldn&rsquo;t have made or found rather arbitrary. (SPOILER: if you received anonymous letter that threatened death unless you went to some abandoned mine shaft, would you go?)</p>
<p>These are minor complaints though compared to the rest of the game. I plan to continue playing it for quite a while yet. It has displaced StarCraft 2, and that has to say something at least.</p>

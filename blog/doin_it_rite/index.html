    <h1 class="article title">Doin' It Rite</h1><p class="article date">2010-02-12</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>I have to call this out in a separate post. All 5 days I was in Ra&rsquo;anana office were mostly spent in meetings with development team leads. At 10am each day we&rsquo;d spend two hours talking about what was resolved, and what needs to be, they were meetings to keep the group focused for the day. The next 6-8 hours were informal meetings between the 2 of us from Release Engineering, and whichever team leads felt like sticking around.</p>
<p>I enjoyed every minute of these discussions. It&rsquo;s not often in one&rsquo;s software career that you get to work with other teams and architect a project from the ground up entirely. Only two of us are going to be implementing the solution, and the problems we&rsquo;ll have to solve on the way are not easy. I&rsquo;m not getting into what it will do or who it will impact, I&rsquo;ll just say it is significant to the company as a whole.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is not to brag about the weeks accomplishments but rather characterize why I&rsquo;m in the software development field in the first place. It&rsquo;s not about writing code, finding bugs, gaining recognition, or managing process. It&rsquo;s about solving hard problems; novel ones that very few have broached before, let alone have the capacity to solve.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of them. Several times during these meetings I or someone else would stop, pause, and utter something to the effect of, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the best way to do this&rdquo;, or simply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I like solving problems on my own, particularly complex ones, but when I need to fly to another country to meet 4 or 5 brilliant people in person to solve a huge laundry list of issues, now we&rsquo;re into a whole new realm of interesting and exciting. Sometimes we&rsquo;d spend an hour or two rat-holed on the same issue just bouncing ideas at each others. Remember I&rsquo;m in a room with a bunch of Israelis too&hellip; so things get animated sometimes. I think next time I&rsquo;ll bring boxing gloves.</p>
<p>Professionally, this business trip was the most engaging and interesting thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. Each day I left the office utterly drained mentally. Maybe the jet lag was a factor too.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t drag this on. This week, I was doin&rsquo; it right.</p>

<p>Fez is an XBLA-only title that focuses puzzles and exploration above everything else. The core mechanic is exploiting your perspective of an apparently 2D world to make matter in 3D space line up the way you want, similar to Paper Mario or Echochrome. <a href="http://vimeo.com/38466193"target="_blank">This gameplay video</a> can do a far better job explaining than I can.</p>
<p>It definitely has the indie feel with shout-outs to older games, and the puzzles here are very imaginative. To complete everything, you&rsquo;ll need to decipher an alphabet, decrypt a number system, solve a few riddles, interpret codes through controller vibrations, translate a language of tetris blocks, scan QR codes, and many other tasks that I struggled with on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>To complete the game you need to find 32 cubes, but there are 64 in the game. 32 of them are gold; these are easy to find. The others are blue, and they are not easy to find. Of course getting them all gets you a fancier ending, and fancy unlockables when you play the game through again. There are also 3 red cubes that don&rsquo;t really do anything except get you bragging rights; they are the hardest of the hard to get.</p>
<p>Except for one puzzle, where the hint is not in the game itself but in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->soundtrack<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I really enjoyed this game. I&rsquo;m glad to have had a chance to encourage thoughful gaming before I get Diablo 3. Zing!</p>

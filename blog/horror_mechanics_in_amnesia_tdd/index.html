    <h1 class="article title">Horror Mechanics in Amnesia: TDD</h1><p class="article date">2010-10-18</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>A few weeks ago I completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a survival horror game that does an excellent job with the horror part. This will be an incomplete review, focusing specifically on the game mechanics that make it work. Frankly I&rsquo;m surprised more games are not like this one, which I do recommend strongly by the way.</p>
<p>First of all, the game is well paced and makes impressive use of sound, light, and atmosphere. You never have a weapon. These are important design decisions for horror but they are not why Amnesia excels at being genuinely scary. The game features a &ldquo;Sanity&rdquo; stat beyond the usual health indicator. If you&rsquo;re standing in darkness or witness supernatural events, your sanity decreases, which results in several debilitating effects. In order of severity they are: blurriness, wondering visions, mumbling and whimpering, crawling on the ground in a panic, and finally &ldquo;death&rdquo; when your sanity is irreversibly lost. You recover sanity from dangerous levels by standing in light, or by literally making progress in the game: solving a puzzle, discovering a new plot lead, etc. Most notably however, your sanity plummets when you look at a monster.</p>
<p>This was a brilliant decision. When a monster spots you, you have no choice but to flee and hide since you have no weapons. Usually this means cowering in darkness which as I said, drains sanity. Looking at the monster is not an option because if your sanity gets low, you will gasp and panic, which makes noise and betrays your position. If you&rsquo;re hiding in a room with a monster, the best thing you can do is look at the floor or wall. This does wonders for provoking real fear.</p>
<p>While exploring you&rsquo;ll also find tinderboxes and lantern oil. The oil is for a lantern you carry with you to provide light. Tinderboxes you can use to light torches and candles scattered throughout the castle you&rsquo;re exploring. There is a subtle dynamic here too. You don&rsquo;t find a ton tinderboxes, but there are enough to light up a lot of rooms in the game. This is good because monsters frequently spawn in darkness, so lighting up the room keeps them at bay. However, you cannot hide in the light, so if one does spawn, you&rsquo;ll be at a disadvantage to escape. Of course, if you leave everything dark, your sanity will always be low, and you&rsquo;ll run into monsters more often.</p>
<p>The monsters come and go as they wish, and they never get repetitive. They always spawn and despawn out of sight, so the game does a great job of making it feel like they can be anywhere and nowhere at the same time. Amnesia makes good use of pacing with them. There is a flooded basement sequence with invisible monsters splashing in the water that is particularly well done, because when that starts, you will be utterly desperate to find high ground.</p>
<p>Play it at night with headphones in the dark. You&rsquo;ll enjoy this one.</p>

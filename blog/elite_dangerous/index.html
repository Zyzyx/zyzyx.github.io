    <h1 class="article title">Elite: Dangerous</h1><p class="article date">2015-05-30</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>My current game to cram in between fits of productivity is <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/"target="_blank">Elite: Dangerous</a>. There are <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/review-elite-dangerous-is-the-best-damn-spaceship-game-ive-ever-played/"target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/elite-dangerous-review/"target="_blank">reviews</a> you can easily find on Google, so I will try not be repetitive here. Instead, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the sense of wonder and exploration the game instills.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The game is a space ship simulator, and it does this very well. You may have heard that space is pretty big! Points of interested may be kilometers, megameters, light-seconds, or light years apart. Players can travel faster than light under the right conditions with a couple button presses, but even when you&rsquo;re cruising at 200 times the speed of light in &ldquo;supercruise&rdquo;, it can still take many minutes to arrive at a destination thousands of light seconds away. When you arrive at a point of interest, such as a space station or planet, you spend quite a bit of time just decelerating. If your timing is off, you&rsquo;ll frequently blow right by the planet or satellite you were looking to stop at. You end up doing the &ldquo;loop of shame&rdquo; where you U-turn at low speed and then accelerate back toward your destination.</p>
<p>The sense of scale is really well done. When you&rsquo;re traveling in &ldquo;normal space&rdquo; instead of supercruise, your speed is measured in kilometers per hour, and celestial bodies hardly move at all. Other ships and small scale debris rip by like you&rsquo;d expect of course. But once you enter supercruise and your speed ticks up from kilometers per second to megameters, to fractions of C (the constant for the speed of light), planets and stars start to whiz by. Sometimes when you enter a new system by &ldquo;Frame Shifting&rdquo;, which is basically teleportation over a distance of 5-40 light years depending on the power of your ship, a station you want is still tens of thousands of light seconds away. You cannot frame-shift within a star system; so you&rsquo;re relegated to traveling in supercruise for literally tens of minutes in real time.</p>
<p>The game attempts to model the whole Milky Way galaxy, and has procedurally generated around 400,000,000,000 (that&rsquo;s billions) star systems for players to explore. The game features a galaxy map you can use to plot routes around space, and it just goes on and on. Lines are drawn between star systems, and they spiderweb in all 3 dimensions seemingly forever. The distance between Sol (our Solar System) and the center of the galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is around 26,000 light years. This amounts to a few nights of frame shifting from system to system, a serious time commitment.</p>
<p>The developers of the game have taken the time to render the stars you see in the backdrop realistically. So if you&rsquo;re out and about in the Horse-head Nebula, the stars you can see will be arranged visibly and luminously as they would be in real life (theoretically). As players approach the center of the galaxy, the stars get brighter and denser.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re big into space exploration you will really enjoy this feature. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/2fj0ix/38_interesting_places_to_see_in_ed/"target="_blank">There are reddits</a> of players recording when they visited or discovered oddities in space such as the largest known water-planet, the brightest proto-star, the coolest neutron star, the first discovered purple gas-giant, or the first black hole. Game-play wise, these discoveries mean little. Players may collect some credits (the in-game currency) as discovery bonuses, but that is the extent of the impact. The desire to discover and explore is purely driven by player interest, not game reward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the kind of game play mechanic I enjoy. Spending a night hopping from system to system is rather repetitive and the likelihood of me noticing I just passed the the largest M-class star is pretty low. However, I can appreciate the effort the developers put into modeling a realistic galaxy. Some players really like this sort of thing, and that&rsquo;s cool too. I will admit the first time I discovered a black hole it was not what I expected at all.</p>
<p>I was preparing for a black sphere floating in space, but the most you&rsquo;ll see is a big gas cloud. Inside somewhere is a black sphere, I assume, but your ship will burn up long before you see it. The cool thing is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens"target="_blank">Gravitational Lensing</a> effect in the gas cloud, where light is being bent by the gravitation field. As a player, you start to see distant stars stretching and warping around your field of view, which is very disorienting. You have to learn to trust your HUD and sensors rather than what you see through the windows of the cockpit as you approach.</p>
<p>Crashing thousands of light years from civilized space with hundreds of thousands of credits worth of cartographical data would be a tragedy. Remember, it took me a few nights&rsquo; worth of traveling just to see it. When several hours of game time are at stake, things get very exciting when you encounter a black hole. Naturally, they&rsquo;re worth a lot of credits to scan and discover. It was worth it for me the first time, but it was an intense experience. Very cool.</p>

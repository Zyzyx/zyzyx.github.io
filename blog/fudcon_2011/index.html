    <h1 class="article title">FUDCon 2011</h1><p class="article date">2011-02-20</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>A few weeks ago I attended FUDCon, the Fedora Users and Developers Conference. This year it took place in Tempe, Arizona at the Arizona State University.</p>
<p>At Red Hat my primary job function is to be the Release Engineer for the company&rsquo;s Cloud and Virtualization products and efforts. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux images in Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 were built by me using tools I wrote internally. Much of the work I&rsquo;ve done has been made public and available to the Fedora community, but there is still a lot of work to do: the work to integrate my tools with Fedora&rsquo;s infrastructure and release process is still on going. My purpose at FUDCon was to sync with stakeholders in Fedora-land and consult as needed for this effort.</p>
<p>Thus I had a list of people at FUDCon I wanted to meet and talk with, but the first half of the convention involves talks and presentations, and they were fantastic this year around. The convention uses the &ldquo;barcamp&rdquo; style of presenting: anyone interested in giving a talk (whether they&rsquo;ve prepared in advance or not) pitches their subject in 15 seconds. More than 40 people did this. Then, attendees vote on which talks they would be interested in. Finally, a schedule is computed, and folks go where they want.</p>
<p>Initially I was surprised to find out the convention is rather small: a little over 200 people attended. There were no vendors or indications of a trade show at all, this is for Users and Developers only. I was very impressed with the content at the talks though, those alone made the trip worth it.</p>
<p>The second half of the convention is composed of &ldquo;hackfests&rdquo;, which are basically impromptu meetings that attendees are encouraged to arrange themselves. The content can be anything; this is basically how the user community connects with developers more personally and interact as needed. This may involve busting out prototype code and services, or just talking over a coffee. I spent most of this time talking with Fedora Release Engineering, the Anaconda team, and other parties interested in EC2, such as the Cloud SIG. I got through my list of people I needed to sync with by the end of Sunday, including a dinner. Monday more hackfests were going on, we basically rent out a bunch of ASU classrooms as needed, and I just hung out at a few as an observer.</p>
<p>Notable people I met by IRC nick in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>dgilmore - Fedora Rel-Eng</li>
<li>jkeating - Former Fedora Rel-Eng</li>
<li>jforbes - Guy responsible for producting Fedora cloud images</li>
<li>The Anaconda Team</li>
<li>skvidal - Yum author</li>
<li>gepetto - Yum/RPM maintainer</li>
<li>mmcgrath - Fedora Infrastructure lead</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely worth the trip, even though Manchester&rsquo;s winter weather kept me an extra day. It was really cool meeting people behind the email address or IRC nicks that I&rsquo;ve been working with for the past few months. It&rsquo;s a wonderful feeling being approached and addressed by random people that others have directed to you. There were also many career-growth opportunities laid out too, many upstream projects need help and are more willing to accept work after they&rsquo;ve met you in person. Would do again.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Gource</h1><p class="article date">2010-01-27</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>This post has a youtube link below that I need to explain before you click on it. It does not involve cats, yelling, dubbing over star trek, griefing in Second Life, crying teens, shitting on someone&rsquo;s porch, Jackass-quality stunts, violence, anal sex, awful mashups, or Halo headshots. So basically nobody is going to give a shit about it except me.</p>
<p>It was generated using Gource, a program that takes the commit logs of an SCM and generates a visualization of activity over a given people of time. An SCM is a Source Code (or Control depending on who you ask) Manager; a program that tracks changes to a directory tree of source code. I use one while developing MetaRPG; every time I change code around and it works well enough for me to be happy with, I commit those changes to git. That way, at any time, I can revert back to the way the code was that I just saved. It&rsquo;s like having a ton of save games that I can revert to at any point in case I want to do something different while writing code.</p>
<p>Anyway the history of commits is recorded in an SCM, and that info is parsed by Gource to create a visualization. What you&rsquo;ll see is a moving map of, for lack of a better term, nodes. Each node is a file or directory of source code. You&rsquo;ll see icons of contributors zooming around lasering those nodes. That represents a commit to the SCM. Yellow lasers are modifications to the files. Green are when a new file is created, red is when one is deleted.</p>
<p>Below is the Gource visualization for Koji, the buildsystem we use for building packages in Fedora. I have personally contributed to this project as part of my work at Red Hat, so you&rsquo;ll see me included briefly at the end. You&rsquo;ll also see Mike Bonnet, whom I work with very often. He is invited to the wedding.</p>
<p>Koji&rsquo;s Gource.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it. Yes I know it needs music. When MetaRPG gets some traction I may create one for it too.</p>

    <h1 class="article title">Dungeon: The Odious Ossuary</h1><p class="article date">2012-07-16</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>Recently the players of 3.5 edition D&amp;D <a href="http://prithiva.brolem.net/index.php/Main_Page"target="_blank">campaign setting</a> completed an extensive dungeon. I cannot say is is the largest one I have done, but it certainly ranks up there. It took 4 sessions to complete (2 of them were only 3 hours long) and is meant for a group of 5-6 5th level players.</p>
<p>The background is <a href="http://prithiva.brolem.net/index.php/Campaign_Summary#Act_3:_Peter.27s_Gavel"target="_blank">archived here</a>. As a stand-alone module, the key mechanic are the Vengeful Encounters, certain triggers will start one. The first 5 are planned, and they get progressively harder. The 6th was not included here, but it was scripted to be more difficult than the players could handle, so if they hit all of them, they would be forced out of the crypt, and ultimately fail the quest here. I also indicated that whenever they left the crypt to recoup, the evil within was stronger when they returned. There are 3 ways into the crypt, each one they take was meant to be one directional, a seal or something would trigger to keep them in. If they went in a 3rd time, they had to remove the curse. If they went in 3 times, and hit all 6 Vengeful Encounters, the party dies. (obviously module-only rules there)</p>
<p>There are two floors that I tracked in Google Docs, a service rapidly infecting my work habits like Apple products infecting non-technical peoples&rsquo; households. You can review them yourself if you like, enjoy!</p>

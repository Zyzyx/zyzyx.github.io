    <h1 class="article title">Vegas Vacation</h1><p class="article date">2012-07-31</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>The last 5 days I have been in Las Vegas, and it is good to be home again. Originally the plan was <a href="http://blog.burdell.org/"target="_blank">David</a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cantrell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I would attend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DefCon 20<!-- raw HTML omitted --> together, but then our wives wanted to come, and naturally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Lumens<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his wife found good reasons to be there too: hiking in the mountains. DefCon only lasted 3 days, but we made a group vacation out of it by adding a couple more.</p>
<p>Friday morning we flew in and I got registered in short order. There was a lot more collateral this year than before: a DefCon music CD, a DVD of the talks, movies, and archives of previous conventions&rsquo; material. The badge this year was the most complex and expensive yet. The talks I attended were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As usual there were a bunch of vendors around, the lockpicking village and various contests. I spent a little time visiting those before heading out for the evening and rejoining the group. We had a show to attend: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tournament of Kings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It certainly was entertaining and filling, but I think the performance by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medieval Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was better. This one was more kid-friendly, and clearly scripted. I know the other one is too, but one did not do as well masking that. We retired to our room at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Luxor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> afterward, blaming the 5.5 hour airplane trip for knocking us out.</p>
<p>At 5am a hooker knocked on our door looking for work.</p>
<p>Saturday was another full day of DefCon and evening shows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the talks I watched the CTF (&ldquo;binjitsu 4&rdquo;) game for a while and won a t-shirt by answering an impromptu trivia question correctly. We attended <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recycled Percussion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which was loud but entertaining. Liz and I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->La Reve<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after that, which is probably the best acrobatic show I&rsquo;ve ever seen, better than Cirque du Soleil&rsquo;s &ldquo;O&rdquo;. Following that was a night of drinking and gambling, until midnight.</p>
<p>Sunday once again David and I met at 8am at a Starbucks and headed out. In the midst of the talks he stopped at the Hardware Hacking Village and soldered his badge pieces together. I still have to do this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That evening we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stuffed ourselves silly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at some &ldquo;Buca&rdquo; restaurant. (I forget the real name) It hurt walking back to the hotel. Some more gambling and shenanigans occured which ended with a late night watching of a re-run of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dog Eat Dog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the Lumens where we got good and angry mocking it and feeling dumber by the minute.</p>
<p>Monday the convention was over, but the vacation was not. The Cantrells and I (Liz had to fly home to go back to work) toured the Hoover Dam, and took the Dam(n) Tour. I&rsquo;ll have to post pictures at some point, the interior of that place is right out of Stalker. In the evening we hit the Bellagio buffet, once against succumbing to gluttony and staggered back to the hotel where we gambled together. I had to call my wife to transfer more money to our bank accounts and refiance the house. Ok, that&rsquo;s an exaggeration but I did lose $250. Hooray Vegas!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to do it again next year. (a Vegas/DefCon trip, not losing money)</p>

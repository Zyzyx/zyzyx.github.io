Well maybe that isn&rsquo;t entirely fair to say, since it&rsquo;s actually 10am where I live.</p>
<p>Thursday we (me and my Dad) arrived and met up at the airport around 3:30. Checked in and walked to the Riviera. We registered and picked up our badges, but by that point there weren&rsquo;t any more talks and the vendor area was still being set up, so we just left and took a cab to the MGM Grand. There we got drunk at a Japanese sushi bar thanks to fancy Sake and beer. Sushi was excellent as well. After that we saw Cirque du Soleil&rsquo;s KA which is perhaps the second greatest show I&rsquo;ve been to, ever. I&rsquo;m considering all live shows I have been to in my life with that statement (the first being O).</p>
<p>With Vegas/Vacation part of the trip over, it was time for DefCon on Friday. We split up most of the time to attend different talks, which are the meat of the conference. I have to say there is a difference between reading about hacks and knowing how to pull them off. Furthermore, there is a bigger difference between knowing how to pull them off, and watching them demonstrated in real time in front of you. You can&rsquo;t appreciate the elegance of SSLstrip until you see someone enter their account information to bankofamerica.com, and watch the information pop up in a text file on another computer entirely. Or watching a bot in World of Warcraft get the highest healing count in Warsong Gulch.</p>
<p>The talks I attended are listed below with a quick 5-star scale review. I&rsquo;ll post more about them if a get a chance later.</p>
<pre><code>(***  ) Perspective of the DoD CSO: Interesting and thought provoking, but little technical content.
(**** ) 0-day gh0stnet and the Inside Story of the Adobe JBIG2: Also pretty cool, in depth analysis of the JBIG2 exploit. There must have been some douche from Adobe there, because someone kept refuting claims until the speaker told him to STFU.
(*****) Subverting the Warcraft API: This was extremely impressive. They had a live demo of their bot fighting in a battleground and leading the healing meters.
(***  ) Proxy Prank-o-Matic: This was some light hearted fun. The hacks aren't really exploits, just an admin configuring their services to do stuff that would make their users blink in confusing when viewing a web page.
(***  ) Malware Freakshow: This was a good presentation, but it really needed to have a longer time slot. They reviewed 4 different types of malware, and it really moved fast.
(*    ) Fragging Game Servers: I should have guessed that a talk led by TF2 gamers would end up being little more than a stream of tired Internet memes. They reviewed a bunch of Source Engine cheats.

<p>Oh yeah I impulse-bought an 11-piece lock pick set. Today or tomorrow I&rsquo;ll learn to use them.</p>

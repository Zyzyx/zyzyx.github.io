            <p class="note title">Vim as an IDE</p><p class="note date">2016-08-02</p><p class="note content">Crap, it&rsquo;s been over a year since posting an update.
Lately at the office I&rsquo;ve had a rare few days where I did not have any high priority work or firedrills to attend to. This is nice because I got a chance to focus on some productivity improvements, and that has been a long time coming for my editor of choice, Vim. I do a lot of Python development at work, and on reddit somewhere I stumbled onto a link that described how to turn Vim into an IDE.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/rachel_greguske/">
            <p class="note title">Rachel Greguske</p><p class="note date">2015-05-31</p><p class="note content">On May 9th after an unplanned procedure our daughter was born 6 weeks early. Last Friday she was finally discharged from the NICU and we began the parental journey.
All I&rsquo;m going to say is that you get an opportunity to start a family of your own, take it.</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/elite_dangerous/">
            <p class="note title">Elite: Dangerous</p><p class="note date">2015-05-30</p><p class="note content">My current game to cram in between fits of productivity is Elite: Dangerous. There are many reviews you can easily find on Google, so I will try not be repetitive here. Instead, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the sense of wonder and exploration the game instills.
The game is a space ship simulator, and it does this very well. You may have heard that space is pretty big! Points of interested may be kilometers, megameters, light-seconds, or light years apart.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/supergiant_games/">
            <p class="note title">Supergiant Games</p><p class="note date">2015-02-02</p><p class="note content">The video game studio Supergiant Games, creators of Bastionand Transistor, have succeeded in becoming one of may favorite studios. Their company goal:
We want to make games that spark your imagination like the games you played as a kid. A bold statement, but I think they&rsquo;ve succeeded. They both sport bright colors and a unique art style that is instantly recognizable. Music supports their games exactly like music should, you can listen to complete albums for Bastionand Transistor.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/getting_my_data_under_control/">
            <p class="note title">Getting My Data Under Control</p><p class="note date">2015-01-25</p><p class="note content">One of my new years&rsquo; resolutions was to better understand how data about me on the internet is being used by corporate entities and governments, and better control it on my end. I realize it is nearly impossible to control it completely, my mortage information was resold mere weeks after getting a house; Google has been vaccuuming up my browsing habits for years, and Verizon does it on my phone. Despite that, my goal is to understand what I can and do what I can.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/moved_to_ghost/">
            <p class="note title">Moved to Ghost</p><p class="note date">2015-01-24</p><p class="note content">A snow storm today ruined my routine for chores around the house. So instead of that I migrated my blog from a Drupal deployment to Ghost. I stuck Google+ comments to it for now too.
I&rsquo;ve been sitting on a few posts for a while, but putting it off to get this migration out of the way. A lot has been going on professionally and personally.</p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/voting_in_2014/">
            <p class="note title">Voting in 2014</p><p class="note date">2014-10-26</p><p class="note content">November 4th is a midterm election day here in the states, but it is not the presidential election day, so it often goes ignored by the American public. How is someone supposed to find time to research multiple candidates for multiple positions? The majority of the ads are negative and filled with exaggerations about how bad the other guy is, so this makes voter education very difficult. Granted, this isn&rsquo;t a good excuse, but it is common enough that it needs to be addressed somehow.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/whisky_live/">
            <p class="note title">Whisky Live</p><p class="note date">2014-10-26</p><p class="note content">On Friday I attended Whisky Live in Boston. It was held on the 33rd floor of 60 State Street, which is a classy venue for sure: tall windows overlooking the city-scape at night, live jazz music, and 43 vendors offering various whiskies.
There were far fewer scotch whiskies there than I expected, and far more bourbons and ryes. There were even some tequilas and vodkas, which I skipped. I noticed a trend of having maple-infused bourbons too, many of the vendors offering such were based in Vermont.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/openwrt/">
            <p class="note title">OpenWRT</p><p class="note date">2014-10-14</p><p class="note content">Yes, I&rsquo;m writing this during a marathon of meetings at the office. I&rsquo;m advocating an Open Source project, so that is close enough to work for now. There&rsquo;s more benefit to the company than these meetings at least.
Last weekend I flashed my router, an ASUS NT-16, with OpenWRT. It was previously flashed with TomatoUSB, but I found out a few months ago that development had pretty much ended. I&rsquo;m not sure where interest went, but I saw that OpenWRT gets a lot of sponsorship from the EFF, so I figured it was a good bet.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/divinity_original_sin/">
            <p class="note title">Divinity: Original Sin</p><p class="note date">2014-10-12</p><p class="note content">Muffin and I have put around 60 hours into Divinity: Original Sin, so I figure it is about time for a review. Born from a very successful Kickstarter campaign, Divinity gives players a taste of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate might have been like if it was released in 2014. For an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; game, it is pretty well designed and polished, except for a few spots which I&rsquo;ll get into later. We have found the whole package a lot of fun and strongly recommend it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
